# Assessing the Population-level Conservation Effects of Marine Protected Areas

This repo contains code and data needed to reproduce “Assessing the
Population-level Conservation Effects of Marine Protected Areas” by
Ovando et al. In Prep.

The script `make-pop-effects-of-mpas.R` will reproduce all results and
manuscripts for this project.

Users will need to install the simulation model that can be found
[here](https://github.com/DanOvando/spasm), and installed using
`remotes::install_github("danovando/spasm")`

> > Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) cover 3-7% of the world’s ocean, up
> > from less than 1% in the year 2000, and international commitments
> > call for 10%, 30%, and even 50% coverage. The premise underlying MPA
> > expansion is that they conserve biodiversity, habitats, and fished
> > populations. While numerous studies show that MPAs produce
> > conservation benefits *inside* their borders, many MPAs are also
> > justified on the grounds that they confer conservation benefits to
> > the broader population *beyond* their borders. This paper examines
> > the conditions under which MPAs can provide population-level
> > conservation benefits inside and outside their borders, and shows
> > that even in cases where the conservation benefits are large, they
> > are inherently difficult to detect empirically. A network of MPAs
> > was put in place in The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary in
> > 2003, with a goal of providing regional conservation and fishery
> > benefits. Evidence indicates that the Channel Island MPAs have
> > increased biomass densities inside the MPAs, but we are unable to
> > find a clear effect of these same MPAs at the population level. MPA
> > effect sizes less than 30% are likely to be difficult to detect
> > (even when they are present), and the size of many MPA networks
> > suggests that effect sizes may often be smaller than 30%. Our
> > results provide a novel assessment of the population-level effects
> > of a large and iconic Marine Protected Area network, and provide
> > guidance for communities charged with monitoring and adapting MPAs.
