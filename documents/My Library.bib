First, the threshold is assumed constant, being then allowed to vary according to past levels of consumption, a proxy for households' water-using equipment and habits. A measure of the depreciation rate of habits is derived and the effectiveness of price and non-price conservation measures are compared. The results provide useful policy recommendations for the studied case of Seville (Spain).},

We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate.},

We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 2000\textendash{}2015, contributed to 75\% more forested area experiencing high ({$>$}1 {$\sigma$}) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for {$\sim$}55\% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 1984\textendash{}2015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.},

The number of individuals employed declined proportionately to the exit of vessels following implementation. Total crew hours dedicated to fishing activities remained roughly constant, while employment in redundant pre- and post-season activities declined due to the consolidation of quota on fewer vessels. We find little evidence of substantial changes in the share contracts used to compensate fishermen. Finally, we explore a wide array of remuneration measures for crew and conclude that both seasonal and daily employment remuneration increased substantially for many crew in the post-rationalization fishery, while remuneration per unit of landings declined as a result of a combination of increased crew productivity and the necessity of paying for fishing quota in the new system.},

However, the adaptive behavior of fishermen, the apex predator in the ecosystem, to MPAs may upset the balance of fishing impacts across species. While ecosystem-based management (EBM) emphasizes the protection of all species in the environment, the weakest stock often dominates management attention. We use data before and after the implementation of large spatial closures in a North Pacific trawl fishery to show how closures designed for red king crab protection spurred dramatic increases in Pacific halibut bycatch due to both direct displacement effects and indirect effects from adaptations in fishermen's targeting behavior. We identify aspects of the ecological and economic context of the fishery that contributed to these surprising behaviors, noting that many multispecies fisheries are likely to share these features. Our results highlight the need either to anticipate the behavioral adaptations of fishermen across multiple species in reserve design, a form of implementation error, or to design management systems that are robust to these adaptations. Failure to do so may yield patterns of fishing effort and mortality that undermine the broader objectives of multispecies management and potentially alter ecosystems in profound ways.},

These reforms would significantly improve the accountability and efficiency of the sector and establish the necessary institutions to resolve allocation disputes in an adaptive, efficient manner through arms-length transactions. I propose a general framework for reform of mixed recreational-commercial fisheries and discuss realistic rights-based policies to better manage fishing mortality for private recreational anglers and facilitate transferability across sectors.

Cabo Pulmo National Park (CPNP) was created in 1995 and is the only well enforced no-take area in the Gulf of California, Mexico, mostly because of widespread support from the local community. In 1999, four years after the establishment of the reserve, there were no significant differences in fish biomass between CPNP (0.75 t ha-1 on average) and other marine protected areas or open access areas in the Gulf of California. By 2009, total fish biomass at CPNP had increased to 4.24 t ha-1 (absolute biomass increase of 3.49 t ha-1, or 463\%), and the biomass of top predators and carnivores increased by 11 and 4 times, respectively. However, fish biomass did not change significantly in other marine protected areas or open access areas over the same time period. The absolute increase in fish biomass at CPNP within a decade is the largest measured in a marine reserve worldwide, and it is likely due to a combination of social (strong community leadership, social cohesion, effective enforcement) and ecological factors. The recovery of fish biomass inside CPNP has resulted in significant economic benefits, indicating that community-managed marine reserves are a viable solution to unsustainable coastal development and fisheries collapse in the Gulf of California and elsewhere.},

This growing popularity comes despite the fact that there are still unresolved questions about the most effective TURF designs. One of the key questions is the role of TURF size in their efficacy both from ecological and social standpoints. This study explores the expected effects of existing TURF sizes on yields for TURF systems in Chile, M{\'e}xico and Japan. The expected effect of larval dispersal and adult movement on yields was simulated for TURFs in each system. The results show that the analyzed TURF systems fall into three main categories: (a) TURFs that are of adequate size to eliminate the expected negative effects of both adult and larval movement, (b) TURFs that are large enough to eliminate the expected negative effects of adult movement, but not the effects of larval dispersal, and c) TURFs that are too small to eliminate the expected impacts on yield of both adult and larval movement. These analyses suggest that either existing models of TURF performance are incomplete or that there is significant scope for improved performance with altered TURF designs. Considering these alternatives, empirical evidence from the TURFs deemed too small suggests that complementary management tools can enhance TURF performance when natural or social constraints prevent the construction of TURFs of optimal size.},

We propose that well-established lessons from MPA design should provide a strong basis for the development of design criteria for TURFs. In this paper, we review the MPA literature to inform the design of TURFs based on the similarities and differences of these 2 marine spatial management tools. We found that TURF design can obtain important lessons from MPA theory, for example on how to diminish the effects of environmental and human disturbance. In particular, the nascent idea of creating TURF networks can benefit significantly from the literature on MPA networks.},

However, this region is poorly studied from a systemic point of view. Our main goal is to develop a holistic view of physical and ecological patterns and processes at austral South America, regarding frontal arrangements. Satellite information (sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentration), and historical hydrographic data were employed to show fronts. We compiled all existing evidence (physical and biological) about fronts to identify regions defined by similar types of coastal fronts and to characterize them. Fronts in austral South America can be arranged in six zones according to their location, main forcing, key physical variables, seasonality, and enrichment mechanisms. Four zones, the Atlantic upwelling zone; the temperate estuarine zone; the Patagonian tidal zone and the Argentine shelf-break zone, occupy most of the Atlantic side. The Chile-Peru upwelling zone, on the Pacific, is the largest and best-known region. The Patagonian cold estuarine zone encompasses the tip of South America, connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and remains poorly studied. When observed at a continental scale, the Pacific coast dominated by two large frontal zones appears simplest than the Atlantic coast in terms of frontal richness. The extension of the continental shelf in the Atlantic coast allows for the development of a great diversity of mesoscale fronts. Though frontal zones we defined are extensive areas of the continental shelves, fronts inside the zones are comparatively small areas. Even so, they play a paramount role in ecological processes, allowing for high biological production; offering feeding and/or reproductive habitats for fishes, squids, and birds; acting as retention areas for larvae of benthic species; and promoting establishment of benthic invertebrates that benefit from the organic production in the frontal area.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {One of the most pressing concerns of environmentalists and policy makers is the overexploitation of natural resources. Efforts to regulate such resources are too often undermined by the people whose livelihoods depend on their use. One of the great challenges for wildlife managers in the twenty-first century is learning to create the conditions under which people will erect effective and workable rules to conserve those resources. James M. Acheson, author of the best-selling Lobster Gangs of Maine (the seminal work on the culture and economics of lobster fishing), here turns his attention to the management of the lobster industry. In this illuminating new book, he shows that resource degradation is not inevitable. Indeed, the Maine lobster fishery is one of the most successful fisheries in the world. Catches have been stable since World War II, and record highs have been achieved since the late 1980s. According to Acheson, these high catches are due, in part, to the institutions generated by the lobster-fishing industry to control fishing practices. These rules are effective.Rational choice theory frames Acheson's down-to-earth study. Rational choice theorists believe that the overexploitation of marine resources stems from their common-pool nature, which results in collective action problems. In fisheries, what is rational for the individual fishermen can lead to disaster for the society. The progressive Maine lobster industry, lobster fishermen, and local groups have solved a series of such problems by creating three different sets of regulations: informal territorial rules; rules to control the number of traps; and formal conservation legislation. In recent years, the industry has successfully influenced new regulations at the federal level and has developed a strong co-management system with the Maine government. The process of developing these rules has been quite acrimonious; factions of fishermen have disagreed over lobster rules designed to give commercial advantage to one group or another. Although fishermen and scientists have come to share a conservation ethic, they often disagree over how to best conserve the lobster and even the quality of science. The importance of Capturing the Commons is twofold: it provides a case study of the management of one highly successful fishery, which can serve as a management model for policy makers, politicians, and local communities; and it adds to the body of theory concerning the conditions under which people will and will not devise institutions to manage natural resources.},

In this article, we use game theory to understand the evolution of institutional arrangements in the Maine lobster fishery. Nash equilibrium of models explains the three stages observed in the local-scale informal system of the past century. These stages are the result of decisions to invade or defend territorial lines that have changed over the course of time in response to a number of factors, including adoption of better technology, transportation costs, ecological changes, ability to organize defensive and offensive groups, and better law enforcement - all captured by crucial parameters of our model. We explore the broader implications of this industry study, especially the issues it raises for rational choice theory and the generation of institutions and norms.},

  abstract = {Research surveys of the brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) were undertaken in The Wash fishery on the east coast of England at up to 22 stations each month from November 1995 to March 2001. These surveys carried out 30-min tows using a commercial fishing vessel, but for obvious logistical reasons stations were sampled at different times of day. This means that light conditions, tidal states and environmental conditions may have varied between stations. Catch rates from these surveys were determined by both catchability and abundance of shrimps, and catchability of Crangon was influenced primarily by emergence behaviour which is controlled by light levels and endogenous rhythms. A preliminary experiment showed that catch rates of shrimps were influenced by light levels in The Wash fishery and so linear modelling techniques were used to examine the influence on catch rates of 18 environmental and physical factors recorded during our surveys. This allowed us to convert catch rates into a standardised index of abundance.},

The original view, which is still widely accepted, holds that the relationship is hump-shaped, with richness first rising and then declining with increasing productivity. Although recent meta-analyses questioned the generality of hump-shaped patterns, these syntheses have been criticized for failing to account for methodological differences among studies. We addressed such concerns by conducting standardized sampling in 48 herbaceous-dominated plant communities on five continents. We found no clear relationship between productivity and fine-scale (meters-2) richness within sites, within regions, or across the globe. Ecologists should focus on fresh, mechanistic approaches to understanding the multivariate links between productivity and richness.

Territorial Use Rights for Fisheries (TURFs) is a fishery management approach that aligns fishers' incentives with sustainability, while marine reserves have proven effective for ecosystem protection, and in some cases for fishery enhancement. These two management approaches are often used in isolation, leaving the potential utility of integrating them poorly understood. We examine cases where TURFs and marine reserves have been implemented together to create ``TURF-reserves''. We compiled a database of 27 TURF-reserves and collected information on the governance, management, enforcement, fishing practices, fishing rights, regulations, and design attributes for each site. We address several research questions including: what species are managed with TURF-reserves, how TURF-reserves are created and who is involved in the process? Our findings show that the majority of surveyed TURF-reserves arose from previously established TURF systems that target a range of fisheries, and multiple entities play a role in TURF-reserve development and management. We also examine the differences between two TURF-reserve archetypes and find that those developed with a strong history of customary tenure share distinct qualities from those created in a more recently established, government-mandated system.},

Although we describe the case study of the Channel Islands, the approach to marine reserve design may be effective in other regions where traditional management alone does not sustain marine resources. A group of agencies, organizations, and individuals established clear goals for marine reserves in the Channel Islands, including conservation of ecosystem biodiversity, sustainable fisheries, economic viability, natural and cultural heritage, and education. Given the constraints of risk management, experimental design, monitoring, and enforcement, scientists recommended at least one, but no more than four, reserves in each biogeographic region. In general, the percentage of an area to be included in a reserve network depends on the goals. In the Channel Islands, after consideration of both conservation goals and the risk from human threats and natural catastrophes, scientists recommended reserving an area of 30\textendash{}50\% of all representative habitats in each biogeographic region. For most species of concern, except pinnipeds and seabirds, information about distributions, dispersal, and population growth was limited. As an alternative to species distribution information, suitable habitats for species of concern were used to locate potential reserve sites. We used a simulated annealing algorithm to identify potential reserve network scenarios that would represent all habitats within the smallest area possible. The analysis produced an array of potential reserve network scenarios that all met the established goals.},

  abstract = {The blue shark has been subject to bycatch fishing mortality in the western North Atlantic for almost a half-century. Nevertheless, stock status is ambiguous and improved input data are needed for stock assessments. It is particularly important to obtain reliable indices of abundance because of the uncertainty in estimates of bycatch. An index of relative abundance (catch-per-unit effort, CPUE) is developed for western North Atlantic blue sharks, starting from the mid-1950s, when industrial pelagic longline tuna fisheries began. Longline catch and effort records from recent observer programs (1980\textendash{}1990s) were linked with longline survey records from both historical archives and recent cruises (1950\textendash{}1990s). Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to remove the effects of diverse fishing target practices, geographical and seasonal variability that affect blue shark catch rates. The analysis revealed a decline in blue shark CPUE of approximately 30\% in the western North Atlantic from 1957 to 2000. The magnitude of this CPUE decline was less than other recently published estimates and seems reasonable in light of the high productivity of the blue shark revealed by life-history studies and preliminary stock assessments.},

  abstract = {Water resources use in agriculture is generally quantified in relation to the harvest. In contrast, this paper takes a consumer perspective by assessing water use in relation to the final consumer product. The paper analyses the water use related to two products that are typical to Italian consumers: pasta and pizza margherita. We use the water footprint concept as a tool to quantify and localise this water use. The water footprint of a product is the volume of freshwater used to produce the product, measured over the various steps of the production chain. We find that the water footprint of dry pasta made in Italy amounts to 1924 l of water per kilogram of pasta. The water footprint of a 725 g pizza margherita is 1216 l of water. The impacts of the water footprints of pasta and pizza depend on the vulnerability of the water systems where the footprints are located. The impact of the water footprint of pasta is most severe in Puglia and Sicily, where groundwater overexploitation for durum wheat irrigation is common. The impact of the water footprint of pizza is more diverse. It is concentrated in the first step of the supply chain of tomato puree and mozzarella, i.e. in the cultivation of tomatoes and the feed crops of dairy cows. The bread wheat used for the pizza base does not have large impacts. The water footprint impact of the tomato puree on the pizza is concentrated in Puglia (groundwater overexploitation and pollution related to tomato cultivation) and Emilia-Romagna (water pollution). The water footprint impact of mozzarella lies mostly in the effects of water use for producing the feed ingredients for the dairy cows.

The size-structured model is nested within the age-size-structured model. The framework can use catch, discard, index of abundance, size- and age-composition, conditional age-at-length, mean length-at-age, and tagging data to estimate model parameters. It is used to explore the sensitivity of key model outputs for Pacific cod in the Eastern Bering Sea by applying model configurations that use the same data, same likelihood functions, and same data weighting schemes. Base model configurations using the three model types all fit the available data adequately, but the age-structured model fits the data better than the size-structured model. Variation in estimates of spawning biomass and the overfishing level was higher among model-types than within model-types. This result highlights the need for assessment analysts to focus more on applying and presenting results for multiple models.},

  abstract = {The intensity of human pressure on marine systems has led to a push for stronger marine conservation efforts. Recently, marine reserves have become one highly advocated form of marine conservation, and the number of newly designated reserves has increased dramatically. Reserves will be essential for conservation efforts because they can provide unique protection for critical areas, they can provide a spatial escape for intensely exploited species, and they can potentially act as buffers against some management miscalculations and unforeseen or unusual conditions. Reserve design and effectiveness can be dramatically improved by better use of existing scientific understanding. Reserves are insufficient protection alone, however, because they are not isolated from all critical impacts. Communities residing within marine reserves are strongly influenced by the highly variable conditions of the water masses that continuously flow through them. To a much greater degree than in terrestrial systems, the scales of fundamental processes, such as population replenishment, are often much larger than reserves can encompass. Further, they offer no protection from some important threats, such as contamination by chemicals. Therefore, without adequate protection of species and ecosystems outside reserves, effectiveness of reserves will be severely compromised. We outline conditions under which reserves are likely to be effective, provide some guidelines for increasing their conservation potential, and suggest some research priorities to fill critical information gaps. We strongly support vastly increasing the number and size of marine reserves; at the same time, strong conservation efforts outside reserves must complement this effort. To date, most reserve design and site selection have involved little scientific justification. They must begin to do so to increase the likelihood of attaining conservation objectives.},

  abstract = {When viewed across long temporal and large spatial scales, severe disturbances in marine ecosystems are not uncommon. Events such as hurricanes, oil spills, disease outbreaks, hypoxic events, harmful algal blooms, and coral bleaching can cause massive mortality and dramatic habitat effects on local or even regional scales. Although designers of marine reserves might assume low risk from such events over the short term, catastrophes are quite probable over the long term and must be considered for successful implementation of reserves. A simple way to increase performance of a reserve network is to incorporate into the reserve design a mechanism for calculating how much additional area would be required to buffer the reserve against effects of catastrophes. In this paper, we develop a method to determine this ``insurance factor'': a multiplier to calculate the additional reserve area necessary to ensure that functional goals of reserves will be met within a given ``catastrophe regime.'' We document and analyze the characteristics of two relatively well-studied types of disturbances: oil spills and hurricanes. We examine historical data to characterize catastrophe regimes within which reserves must function and use these regimes to illustrate the application of the insurance factor. This tool can be applied to any reserve design for which goals are defined by a quantifiable measure, such as a fraction of shoreline, that is necessary to accomplish a particular function. In the absence of such quantitative measures, the concept of additional area as insurance against catastrophes may still be useful.},

We compare the vulnerability of 132 national economies to potential climate change impacts on their capture fisheries using an indicator-based approach. Countries in Central and Western Africa (e.g. Malawi, Guinea, Senegal, and Uganda), Peru and Colombia in north-western South America, and four tropical Asian countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Yemen) were identified as most vulnerable. This vulnerability was due to the combined effect of predicted warming, the relative importance of fisheries to national economies and diets, and limited societal capacity to adapt to potential impacts and opportunities. Many vulnerable countries were also among the world's least developed countries whose inhabitants are among the world's poorest and twice as reliant on fish, which provides 27\% of dietary protein compared to 13\% in less vulnerable countries. These countries also produce 20\% of the world's fish exports and are in greatest need of adaptation planning to maintain or enhance the contribution that fisheries can make to poverty reduction. Although the precise impacts and direction of climate-driven change for particular fish stocks and fisheries are uncertain, our analysis suggests they are likely to lead to either increased economic hardship or missed opportunities for development in countries that depend upon fisheries but lack the capacity to adapt.},

With a focus on small-scale developing-country fisheries in particular, we argue that basing the case for fishery governance reform on assumed economic incentives for resource stewardship is insufficient when there are other sources of insecurity in people's lives that are unrelated to the state of fishery resources. We argue that more secure, less vulnerable fishers make more effective and motivated fishery managers in the context of participatory or rights-based fisheries governance, and we further suggest that insecurity among fishers living in poverty can be most effectively addressed by social and political development that invokes the existing legal framework supporting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This perspective goes well beyond the widely advocated notion of `rights-based fishing' and aligns what fishery sector analysts call the `rights-based approach' with the same terminology used in the context of international development. Embedding the fisheries governance challenge within a broader perspective of human rights enhances the chances of achieving both human development and resource sustainability outcomes in small-scale fisheries of developing countries.},

  abstract = {Networks of no-take reserves are important for protecting coral reef biodiversity from climate change and other human impacts. Ensuring that reserve populations are connected to each other and non-reserve populations by larval dispersal allows for recovery from disturbance and is a key aspect of resilience. In general, connectivity between reserves should increase as the distance between them decreases. However, enhancing connectivity may often tradeoff against a network's ability to representatively sample the system's natural variability. This ``representation'' objective is typically measured in terms of species richness or diversity of habitats, but has other important elements (e.g., minimizing the risk that multiple reserves will be impacted by catastrophic events). Such representation objectives tend to be better achieved as reserves become more widely spaced. Thus, optimizing the location, size and spacing of reserves requires both an understanding of larval dispersal and explicit consideration of how well the network represents the broader system; indeed the lack of an integrated theory for optimizing tradeoffs between connectivity and representation objectives has inhibited the incorporation of connectivity into reserve selection algorithms. This article addresses these issues by (1) updating general recommendations for the location, size and spacing of reserves based on emerging data on larval dispersal in corals and reef fishes, and on considerations for maintaining genetic diversity; (2) using a spatial analysis of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to examine potential tradeoffs between connectivity and representation of biodiversity and (3) describing a framework for incorporating environmental fluctuations into the conceptualization of the tradeoff between connectivity and representation, and that expresses both in a common, demographically meaningful currency, thus making optimization possible.},

In many tropical nations, fisheries management requires a community-based approach because small customary marine tenure areas define the spatial scale of management [1]. However, the fate of larvae originating from a community's tenure is unknown, and thus the degree to which a community can expect their management actions to replenish the fisheries within their tenure is unclear [2, 3]. Furthermore, whether and how much larval dispersal links tenure areas can provide a strong basis for cooperative management [4, 5]. Using genetic parentage analysis, we measured larval dispersal from a single, managed spawning aggregation of squaretail coral grouper (Plectropomus areolatus) and determined its contribution to fisheries replenishment within five community tenure areas up to 33~km from the aggregation at Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. Within the community tenure area containing the aggregation, 17\%\textendash{}25\% of juveniles were produced by the aggregation. In four adjacent tenure areas, 6\%\textendash{}17\% of juveniles were from the aggregation. Larval dispersal kernels predict that 50\% of larvae settled within 14~km of the aggregation. These results strongly suggest that both local and cooperative management actions can provide fisheries benefits to communities over small spatial scales.},

Here, we provide empirical data demonstrating fish conservation benefits of partial MPA when the stocks in question are mainly exploited by recreational angling. We studied a multi-species recreational fishery from the Balearic Islands (Mediterranean Sea) comparing three kinds of spatially close managed areas. The implementation of a partial MPA decreased the fishing pressure attracted, and the protected areas hosted greater abundances and larger-sized fish compared to areas of open access. Possibly the greatest conservation benefit of partial MPA resulted from the reduced fishing effort attracted, likely as a result of aversion of anglers to use areas where some form of management is affecting the recreational experience. In addition, the constraints on artisanal fishing may also have contributed to the conservation benefits we found. Depending on the right social and ecological context, partial MPA may therefore work as expected. Our study is observational and therefore cause-and-effect cannot be conclusively provided. However, our positive data suggest that more empirical data from other recreational fisheries and stocks should be collected before discarding the use of partial MPA in terms of providing a suitable compromise between conservation objectives and securing access to resources.},

We studied the exploitation dynamics and the vulnerability consequences of individual heterogeneity in movement-related behaviors in free-ranging pearly razorfish (Xyrichthys novacula). Using underwater-video recording, we firstly document a fast and high exploitation rate of about 60\% of the adult population removed in just few days after the opening of the season. Subsequently, we tagged a sample of individuals with acoustic transmitters and studied whether behavioral traits were significant predictors of the vulnerability to angling. Tagged individuals revealed repeatable behaviors in several home range-related traits, suggesting the presence of spatial behavioral types. The individuals surviving the experimental fishery showed only localized and low-intensity movement patterns. Our study provides new insights for understanding the harvesting pressures and selective properties acting on behavioral traits of recreational fishing. Many fish stocks around the globe are today predominantly exploited by recreational fisheries. The fisheries-induced change in fish behavior described here may be therefore widespread, and has the potential to alter food-webs, profitability of the fisheries and to affect stock assessment by eroding catchability in the long-term.},

Estimating bycatch, i.e. the incidental catch of non-target marine animals and undersized individuals of target species, by raising observer data to the whole fishery is routine practice. The annual bycatch of the European tropical tuna purse-seine fishery over the period 2003\textendash{}2009 was estimated at 11 590 t [95\% confidence interval: (8165\textendash{}15 818 t)], corresponding to 4.7\% of the tuna landings. An analysis of the variability in the precision of this estimate, based on generalized linear models and Monte Carlo simulations, showed that the current sampling coverage of the tropical tuna fishery observer programme, which is 4.6\% of the fishing trips, resulted in large uncertainties in bycatch estimates by species, i.e. none of the estimates have a relative root mean square error smaller than 50\%. Although the overall magnitude of bycatch of the fishery appeared to be small, the current sampling coverage was insufficient to give any reliable estimate for low-occurring species, such as marine turtles, some oceanic pelagic sharks, and some billfishes. Increasing the sampling coverage would likely improve bycatch estimates. Simulation outputs were produced to help define (i) trade-offs between the priority species to be monitored, (ii) the estimation precision, (iii) expected accuracy, and (iv) the associated sampling costs.},

We quantify footprints using high-resolution satellite vessel monitoring system (VMS) and logbook data on 24 continental shelves and slopes to 1,000-m depth over at least 2 years. Trawling footprint varied markedly among regions: from {$<$}10\% of seabed area in Australian and New Zealand waters, the Aleutian Islands, East Bering Sea, South Chile, and Gulf of Alaska to {$>$}50\% in some European seas. Overall, 14\% of the 7.8 million-km2 study area was trawled, and 86\% was not trawled.

The implication made is that current theory and practice severely underestimate the importance of larger females for population replenishment.

However, current methods for joint inference about temporal and spatial dynamics (e.g. spatiotemporal modelling with Gaussian random fields) may perform poorly when underlying processes include extreme events. Here we introduce a model that allows for extremes to occur si-multaneously in time and space. Our model is a Bayesian predictive-process GLMM (generalized linear mixed-effects model) that uses a multivariate-t distribution to describe spatial random effects. The approach is easily implemented with our flexible R package glmmfields. First, using simulated data, we demonstrate the ability to recapture spatiotemporal extremes, and explore the consequences of fitting models that ignore such extremes. Second, we predict tree mortality from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks in the US Pacific Northwest over the last 16 years. We show that our approach provides more accurate and precise predictions compared to traditional spatiotemporal models when extremes are present. Our R package makes these models accessible to a wide range of ecologists and scientists in other disciplines interested in fitting spatiotemporal GLMMs, with and without extremes.

One increasingly harvested group is sea cucumbers (class Holothuroidea), which are highly valued in Asia and sold as trepang or b{\^e}che-de-mer. We compiled global landings, economic data, and country-specific assessment and management reports to synthesize global trends in sea cucumber fisheries, evaluate potential drivers, and test for local and global serial exploitation patterns. Although some sea cucumber fisheries have existed for centuries, catch trends of most individual fisheries followed boom-and-bust patterns since the 1950s, declining nearly as quickly as they expanded. New fisheries expanded five to six times faster in 1990 compared to 1960 and at an increasing distance from Asia, encompassing a global fishery by the 1990s. Global sea cucumber production was correlated to the Japanese yen at a leading lag. Regional assessments revealed that population declines from overfishing occurred in 81\% of sea cucumber fisheries, average harvested body size declined in 35\%, harvesters moved from near- to off-shore regions in 51\% and from high- to low-value species in 76\%. Thirty-eight per cent of sea cucumber fisheries remained unregulated, and illegal catches were of concern in half. Our results suggest that development patterns of sea cucumber fisheries are largely predictable, often unsustainable and frequently too rapid for effective management responses. We discuss potential ecosystem and human community consequences and urge for better monitoring and reporting of catch and abundance, proper scientific stock assessment and consideration of international trade regulations to ensure long-term and sustainable harvesting of sea cucumbers worldwide.},

Thus harvesters in a single fishery, with a single total allowable catch, concurrently must respond strategically to the behavior not only of those being managed as they are but also of those facing incentives of different management. In a novel quasi-continuous time experimental environment with a contemporaneous price externality, we explore the effort timing behavior of harvesters managed under common pool (CP) management with that of subjects managed with individual quotas (IQ). Consistent with Nash equilibrium, CP-managed subjects race-to-fish, exerting high levels of effort to secure landings but selling at correspondingly low prices. IQ-managed subjects in the same fishery hold effort back until the CP fishery closes, and use their quota over the balance of the season at a lower weekly landings level, receiving higher prices. After experiencing both management systems, subjects choose to be in a group with IQ by a 3:1 margin. (JEL Q22, Q28, C73)},

  abstract = {Individuals relying on natural resource extraction for their livelihood face high income variability driven by a mix of environmental, biological, management, and economic factors. Key to managing these industries is identifying how regulatory actions and individual behavior affect income variability, financial risk, and, by extension, the economic stability and the sustainable use of natural resources. In commercial fisheries, communities and vessels fishing a greater diversity of species have less revenue variability than those fishing fewer species. However, it is unclear whether these benefits extend to the actions of individual fishers and how year-to-year changes in diversification affect revenue and revenue variability. Here, we evaluate two axes by which fishers in Alaska can diversify fishing activities. We show that, despite increasing specialization over the last 30 years, fishing a set of permits with higher species diversity reduces individual revenue variability, and fishing an additional permit is associated with higher revenue and lower variability. However, increasing species diversity within the constraints of existing permits has a fishery-dependent effect on revenue and is usually (87\% probability) associated with increased revenue uncertainty the following year. Our results demonstrate that the most effective option for individuals to decrease revenue variability is to participate in additional or more diverse fisheries. However, this option is expensive, often limited by regulations such as catch share programs, and consequently unavailable to many individuals. With increasing climatic variability, it will be particularly important that individuals relying on natural resources for their livelihood have effective strategies to reduce financial risk.},

  abstract = {Fishery managers must often reconcile conflicting estimates of population status and trend. Superensemble models, commonly used in climate and weather forecasting, may provide an effective solution. This approach uses predictions from multiple models as covariates in an additional ``superensemble'' model fitted to known data. We evaluated the potential for ensemble averages and superensemble models (ensemble methods) to improve estimates of population status and trend for fisheries. We fit four widely applicable data-limited models that estimate stock biomass relative to equilibrium biomass at maximum sustainable yield (B/BMSY). We combined these estimates of recent fishery status and trends in B/BMSY with four ensemble methods: an ensemble average and three superensembles (a linear model, a random forest and a boosted regression tree). We trained our superensembles on 5,760 simulated stocks and tested them with cross-validation and against a global database of 249 stock assessments. Ensemble methods substantially improved estimates of population status and trend. Random forest and boosted regression trees performed the best at estimating population status: inaccuracy (median absolute proportional error) decreased from 0.42 \textendash{} 0.56 to 0.32 \textendash{} 0.33, rank-order correlation between predicted and true status improved from 0.02 \textendash{} 0.32 to 0.44 \textendash{} 0.48 and bias (median proportional error) declined from -0.22 \textendash{} 0.31 to -0.12 \textendash{} 0.03. We found similar improvements when predicting trend and when applying the simulation-trained superensembles to catch data for global fish stocks. Superensembles can optimally leverage multiple model predictions; however, they must be tested, formed from a diverse set of accurate models and built on a data set representative of the populations to which they are applied.},

After decades of overfishing since industrialization, many global fish stocks have recovered, a change brought about through effective management. We provide a synthetic overview of three approaches that managers use to sustain stocks: regulating catch and fishing mortality, regulating effort and regulating spatial access. Within each of these approaches, we describe common restrictions, how they alter incentives to change fishing behaviour, and the resultant ecological, economic and community-level outcomes. For each approach, we present prominent case-studies that illustrate behaviour and the corresponding performance. These case-studies show that sustaining target stocks requires a hard limit on fishing mortality under most conditions, but that additional measures are required to generate economic benefits. Different systems for allocation allow stakeholder communities to strike a locally acceptable balance between profitability and employment.},

Our findings show that women and minorities are still a small portion of tenure-track faculty and federal-government professionals, likely because of systemic biases and cultural barriers.

And yet, for too long, the considerable importance and impacts of recreational fisheries have been ignored. Policymakers and managers need to acknowledge and address the recreational fisheries sector, rethink management objectives and schemes, involve recreational fishers in decision-making processes, incentivize sustainable angler behavior, and improve data collection and monitoring. Recreational fisheries deserve to be considered on equal footing with commercial fisheries, particularly in mixed coastal fisheries.

Although commercial capture fisheries globally harvest about 8 times the fish biomass caught by recreational fisheries (4), in many localities recreational landings now rival or even exceed the biomass removals by commercial fisheries. In inland waters in the temperate zone, recreational anglers are now the predominant users of wild fish stocks (5), and recreational fishers have become prevalent in many coastal and marine fisheries (6, 7). Globally, recreational fishers catch about 47 billion individual fish per year, of which more than half are released alive (4), either because of harvest regulations or in response to personal ethics (8). Despite high release rates, fishing for food is a strong motive and justification for recreational fisheries (9). Beyond nutritional benefits, recreational fisheries provide a range of psychological, social, educational, and economic benefits to fishers and society that are \ldots{}

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the optimal management of fisheries in the ecological context. All fish stocks are embedded in an ecosystem. Therefore, to obtain maximum economic benefits, fisheries management must take due account of the corresponding web of ecological interrelationships. Unfortunately, however, due to the inherent complexity of ecosystems and the scarcity of the relevant empirical information, sensible ecological fisheries management is very difficult to achieve in most cases. This paper suggests a particular application of the individual transferable share quota (ITSQ) system that offers a potentially fruitful approach to the problem of ecological fisheries management. Under the particular ITSQ framework defined in the paper, the task of the fisheries manager is reduced to that of determining the current optimal vector of total allowable catch (TAC); i.e., the one that maximizes the present value of current and expected future fisheries rents from the ecosystem. Given the customary assumptions about market efficiency, this can be shown to be equivalent to setting TACs so that share quota prices are maximized. Since share quota prices are directly observable in the quota market, this is a comparatively easy task for the fisheries manager. This procedure, referred to as minimum information management (MIM) in the paper, obviously greatly simplifies the ecological fisheries management problem. An interesting implication of the analysis is that in the ecological context, economic optimality may easily require some TACs and some share quota prices to be negative.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the allocation problem arising from conflicting demands for marine resource use by (i) commercial fishers, (ii) recreational fishers, and (iii) conservationists. It is shown that decentralised trading of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) is capable of an efficient allocation of resource use between the first two parties. In contrast, it is found that the standard ITQ system is not capable of performing the same ideal co-ordination between the conflicting interests of extractive users, that is, all fishers, and the non-extractive ones, that is, conservationists. The reason is that quota trades between individual fishers and conservationists are inevitably accompanied by (positive) externalities on both other fishers and conservationists. As a result, decentralised quota trades between these parties cannot be efficient. The fundamental economic observation is that quotas for conservation and for extraction constitute two different goods. It follows that a socially optimal market allocation of these two goods requires two prices instead of the single quota price in the standard ITQ system. Thus, to achieve efficiency, the ITQ system has to be extended to incorporate both types of goods. It is shown in the paper that if fishers and conservationists can organise themselves into groups, trades of conservation quotas between the two groups can in principle lead to fully efficient allocation. An interesting implication of this modified ITQ system is that the need for a fisheries authority to set the total allowable catch (TACs) disappears.},

The number of possible fisheries management systems is very large, as demonstrated in the paper. It is obviously not practical to compare the empirical outcomes of all these systems. It is therefore potentially very useful to develop a reasonably simple measure to assess the economic efficiency of the various fisheries management systems that may be proposed. Luckily, it turns out that by appealing to the basic theory of property rights and economic efficiency such measures are available. In the paper, two such measures are proposed; a simple graphical measure based on radar diagrams and a more flexible numerical measure, referred to as the Q-measure. The properties of these measures are discussed in the paper and their use illustrated by means of examples.},

  abstract = {Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) are one of the property rights instruments that have been employed to improve economic efficiency in fisheries. ITQs are not high-quality property rights in the basic fundamental marine resources on which fisheries are based. As a result ITQs cannot be expected to generate full efficiency in the use of these resources. This article examines to what extent ITQs are capable of generating economic efficiency in fisheries. It is shown that ITQs can greatly improve efficiency in fishing. Moreover, by including recreational fishers in the system, ITQs can strike an efficient balance between commercial and recreational fishing. On the negative side, it is shown that on their own, ITQs are not capable of generating full efficiency in fisheries. In particular, ITQs are not sufficient for setting the socially optimal total allowable catch, ensuring the optimal use of the ecosystem, or harmonizing fishing with conflicting uses of marine resources such as marine tourism, mining, and conservation. Potentially counteracting these limitations, ITQ holders as a group have an incentive to manage overall ecosystem use for the long-term benefit of their fishery and negotiate the adjustment of their fishing activity toward the interests of conflicting uses of the marine resources.

  abstract = {To a certain degree, Eastern Boundary Current (EBC) ecosystems are similar: Cold bottom water from moderate depths, rich in nutrients, is transported to the euphotic zone by a combination of trade winds, Coriolis force and Ekman transport. The resultant high primary production fuels a rich secondary production in the upper pelagic and nearshore zones, but where O2 exchange is restricted, it creates oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) at shelf and upper slope (Humboldt and Benguela Current) or slope depths (California Current). These hypoxic zones host a specifically adapted, small macro- and meiofauna together with giant sulphur bacteria that use nitrate to oxydise H2S. In all EBC, small polychaetes, large nematodes and other opportunistic benthic species have adapted to the hypoxic conditions and co-exist with sulphur bacteria, which seem to be particularly dominant off Peru and Chile. However, a massive reduction of macrobenthos occurs in the core of the OMZ. In the Humboldt Current area the OMZ ranges between {$<$}100 and about 600 m, with decreasing thickness in a poleward direction. The OMZ merges into better oxygenated zones towards the deep sea, where large cold-water mega- and macrofauna occupy a dominant role as in the nearshore strip. The Benguela Current OMZ has a similar upper limit but remains shallower. It also hosts giant sulphur bacteria but little is known about the benthic fauna. However, sulphur eruptions and intense hypoxia might preclude the coexistence of significant mega- und macrobenthos. Conversely, off North America the upper limit of the OMZ is considerably deeper (e.g., 500?600 m off California and Oregon), and the lower boundary may exceed 1000m.  The properties described are valid for very cold and cold (La Ni{\~n}a and "normal") ENSO conditions with effective upwelling of nutrient-rich bottom water. During warm (El Ni{\~n}o) episodes, warm water masses of low oxygen concentration from oceanic and equatorial regions enter the upwelling zones, bringing a variety of (sub)tropical immigrants. The autochthonous benthic fauna emigrates to deeper water or poleward, or suffers mortality. However, some local macrofaunal species experience important population proliferations, presumably due to improved oxygenation (in the southern hemisphere), higher temperature tolerance, reduced competition or the capability to use different food. Both these negative and positive effects of El Ni{\~n}o influence local artisanal fisheries and the livelihood of coastal populations. In the Humboldt Current system the hypoxic seafloor at outer shelf depths receives important flushing from the equatorial zone, causing havoc on the sulphur bacteria mats and immediate recolonisation of the sediments by mega- and macrofauna. Conversely, off California, the intruding equatorial water masses appear to have lower oxygen than ambient waters, and may cause oxygen deficiency at upper slope depths. Effects of this change have not been studied in detail, although shrimp and other taxa appear to alter their distribution on the continental margin. Other properties and reactions of the two Pacific EBC benthic ecosystems to El Ni{\~n}o seem to differ, too, as does the overall impact of major episodes (e.g., 1982/1983(1984) vs. 1997/1998). The relation of the "Benguela Ni{\~n}o" to ENSO seems unclear although many Pacific-Atlantic ocean and atmosphere teleconnections have been described. Warm, low-oxygen equatorial water seems to be transported into the upwelling area by similar mechanisms as in the Pacific, but most major impacts on the eukaryotic biota obviously come from other, independent perturbations such as an extreme eutrophication of the sediments ensuing in sulphidic eruptions and toxic algal blooms.  Similarities and differences of the Humboldt and California Current benthic ecosystems are discussed with particular reference to ENSO impacts since 1972/73. Where there are data available, the authors include the Benguela Current ecosystem as another important, non-Pacific EBC, which also suffers from the effects of hypoxia.},

  abstract = {Sustainability of global fisheries is a growing concern. The United Nations has identified three pillars of sustainability: economic development, social development, and environmental protection. The fisheries literature suggests that there are two key trade-offs among these pillars of sustainability. First, poor ecological health of a fishery reduces economic profits for fishers, and second, economic profitability of individual fishers undermines the social objectives of fishing communities. Although recent research has shown that management can reconcile ecological and economic objectives, there are lingering concerns about achieving positive social outcomes. We examined trade-offs among the three pillars of sustainability by analyzing the Fishery Performance Indicators, a unique dataset that scores 121 distinct fishery systems worldwide on 68 metrics categorized by social, economic, or ecological outcomes. For each of the 121 fishery systems, we averaged the outcome measures to create overall scores for economic, ecological, and social performance. We analyzed the scores and found that they were positively associated in the full sample. We divided the data into subsamples that correspond to fisheries management systems with three categories of access\textemdash{}open access, access rights, and harvest rights\textemdash{}and performed a similar analysis. Our results show that economic, social, and ecological objectives are at worst independent and are mutually reinforcing in both types of managed fisheries. The implication is that rights-based management systems should not be rejected on the basis of potentially negative social outcomes; instead, social considerations should be addressed in the design of these systems.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a generalization of the widely used difference-in-differences method for evaluating the effects of policy changes. We propose a model that allows the control and treatment groups to have different average benefits from the treatment. The assumptions of the proposed model are invariant to the scaling of the outcome. We~provide conditions under which the model is nonparametrically identified and propose an estimator that can be applied using either repeated cross section or panel data. Our approach provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would have been experienced by the treatment group in the absence of the treatment and likewise for the untreated group in the presence of the treatment. Thus, it enables the evaluation of policy interventions according to criteria such as a mean\textendash{}variance trade-off. We~also propose methods for inference, showing that our estimator for the average treatment effect is root-N consistent and asymptotically normal. We~consider extensions to allow for covariates, discrete dependent variables, and multiple groups and time periods.},

Simulation results showed that the Lbar estimator of fishing mortality was relatively insensitive to trends in recruitment, and demonstrated favourable properties for detecting statistical differences between sustainable and non-sustainable rates of exploitation. Rates of F estimated from fishery-dependent size composition data were comparable to F estimates from catch-and-effort time-series. Average length was also estimated from fishery-independent diver surveys for 22 species in the exploited snapper\textendash{}grouper complex.

Based on diffusion of innovations theory, the overall purpose of the study is to examine the extent to which social media are adopted within public health agencies and moderators of adoption. Findings demonstrate overall low adoption rates for social media tools. However, significant differences were observed for adoption based on size of communities, with urban communities exhibiting highest adoption rates, followed by suburban, large town, and rural communities. The most frequently cited barrier practitioners named for why they don't think constituents would benefit from health information distributed online was lack of home access to the Internet. Among the 17 percent of practitioners who indicate they use social media to disseminate health information, the most commonly used tools are social networking sites followed by the new media release, blogs, and discussion boards. Rural areas, although lowest in overall social media use, report highest use of podcasting. Implications regarding health and health information disparities are discussed, a potentially new motivation for innovation adoption is introduced, and future studies to follow the S-shaped adoption curve are proposed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a method of utilizing spatial information, usually intrinsic in spatial data sets, to improve the quality of temporal predictions within the framework of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) techniques. Those constitute a model free approach to time series analysis and SSA can be applied to any time series with a notable structure. Indeed it has a wide area of application including social sciences, medical sciences, finance, environmental sciences, mathematics, dynamical systems and economics. The aim of SSA is twofold: i) to make a decomposition of the original series into a sum of a small number of independent and interpretable components such as a slowly varying trend, oscillatory components and a structureless noise; ii) to reconstruct the decomposed series to make a forecast in the absence of the noise component. It has two stages each with two steps. The first stage is the Decomposition Stage with steps comprising: (i) embedding\textendash{}a usual procedure in time series analysis; the result of which is a called a trajectory matrix in SSA literature; (ii) singular value decomposition step that computes and arranges eigenvalues of this matrix for further analysis. The second stage is the Reconstruction Stage: it comprises two steps of (i) grouping the eigenvalues of the SVD step and (ii) diagonal averaging that works on the grouped matrices to realize a series close to the original series and this series is then used for further analysis. Multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (MSSA) is an extension of SSA to multivariate statistics and takes advantage of the delay procedure to obtain a similar formulation as SSA though with larger matrices for multivariate data. In environmental sciences and other areas where spatial data is an important focus of investigation, it is not uncommon to have attributes whose values change with space and time and an accurate prediction is thus important. Spatial dependence subsequently influences data analysis. The usual question asked is whether the location parameters can be of use in the analysis of such data sets. We present a method that can be used to harness the location attributes to enhance prediction of spatial data sets using an MSSA approach. This technique is applied to climate data recordings (particularly rainfall data) from Upper Austria.},

We examine governance institutions in California's 445 groundwater basins using a new dataset to identify factors that influence the adoption of extraction controls. In 309 basins, institutions allow unconstrained pumping, while an additional 105 basins have weak management plans. Twenty of these basins are severely overdrafted. Meanwhile, users in 31 basins have defined groundwater property rights, the most complete solution. We document the critical role of the transaction costs associated with contracting in explaining this variation in responses.

Even in single-species management, time and area closures have been applied without a clear understanding of what their effect might be on identifying overfishing thresholds and other reference points. For EBFM, spatial zoning of the marine environment, including no-take marine reserves and areas where destructive fishing gears are prohibited, may become a prime management tool. Therefore, indicators of the effectiveness of spatial management will be required, along with an understanding of how indicators related to other objectives will be influenced. We review single-species models that have been used to model spatial zoning, including potential bias in assessment and current work on effort reallocation after area closure, as well as available ecosystem-based models and metrics and how they might account for spatial management. Metrics that can be derived from explicitly spatial approaches such as GIS-based ecosystem and fishery evaluations are also discussed.},

Combining and analyzing a unique set of long-term time series of ecologic data in and out of fisheries closures from disparate regions, we found that the time to initial detection of direct effects on target species ({$\pm$}SE) was 5.13 {$\pm$} 1.9 years, whereas initial detection of indirect effects on other taxa, which were often trait mediated, took significantly longer (13.1 {$\pm$} 2.0 years). Most target species showed initial direct effects, but their trajectories over time were highly variable. Many target species continued to increase, some leveled off, and others decreased. Decreases were due to natural fluctuations, fishing impacts from outside reserves, or indirect effects from target species at higher trophic levels. The average duration of stable periods for direct effects was 6.2 {$\pm$} 1.2 years, even in studies of more than 15 years. For indirect effects, stable periods averaged 9.1 {$\pm$} 1.6 years, although this was not significantly different from direct effects. Populations of directly targeted species were more stable in reserves than in fished areas, suggesting increased ecologic resilience. This is an important benefit of marine reserves with respect to their function as a tool for conservation and restoration.},

  abstract = {A management strategy evaluation (based on five species in the California, USA, nearshore fishery) of control rules that reduce relative fishing effort as a function of the ratio of fish density outside versus inside no-take marine reserves (as a measure of depletion) showed that although the control rules allowed effort to increase at first, in the long term, they were effective at maintaining spawning stock biomass and yield for all simulated species, including depleted ones. Scenarios with fish movement, illegal fishing in the reserve, or post-dispersal density dependence in recruitment required higher density ratio targets, such as 60\% of mature fish or 80\% of all fish, to avoid stock depletion. The effort allowed by multispecies density-ratio control rules depended on the relative weight given to more or less depleted species. High variability in recruitment or in monitoring data caused the allowable effort to fluctuate. Density-ratio control rules have the advantages that they require no historical data, they can be used at local spatial scales, and they adjust to changing environmental conditions.},

We used a time series (2001\textendash{}2014) of underwater videos from submersibles and remotely operated vehicles to determine whether a series of MPAs established in early 2009 along the southeast United States Atlantic coast has increased the number of fish species, density of fished species, or the density of Rhomboplites aurorubens (Cuvier, 1829) compared to adjacent, non-reserve areas. We used univariate and multivariate approaches at two spatial scales (region-wide and MPA-specific) to test for a change in the number or density of fish species inside compared to outside MPAs. Overall, 185 fish taxa were observed from 1021 video transects across all years of the study. We did not observe a higher number of species, density of fished species, or density of R. aurorubens inside compared to outside MPAs, either after region-wide standardization using generalized additive models or for nominal analyses focusing on two (Edisto or North Florida) MPAs. Using non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity, we did not observe any change in community structure occurring inside the MPAs that was not simultaneously occurring outside the MPAs, both at the region-wide or MPA-level scale. We did not detect unique changes to the fish community inside MPAs after their creation, which could be due to low statistical power, not enough data post-MPA creation, low compliance rates, or suboptimal MPA shape and size, or some combination thereof. Given their current relatively low abundances, the sampling effort required to effectively assess potential MPA effects for most grouper species is well beyond current or historical levels of sampling.},

  abstract = {Marine species with pelagic larvae typically exhibit little population structure, suggesting long-distance dispersal and high gene flow. Directly quantifying dispersal of marine fishes is challenging but important, particularly for the design of marine protected areas (MPAs). Here, we studied kelp rockfish (Sebastes atrovirens) sampled along 25 km of coastline in a boundary current-dominated ecosystem and used genetic parentage analysis to identify dispersal events and characterize them, because the distance between sedentary parents and their settled offspring is the lifetime dispersal distance. Large sample sizes and intensive sampling are critical for increasing the likelihood of detecting parent\textendash{}offspring matches in such systems and we sampled more than 6,000 kelp rockfish and analysed them with a powerful set of 96 microhaplotype markers. We identified eight parent\textendash{}offspring pairs with high confidence, including two juvenile fish that were born inside MPAs and dispersed to areas outside MPAs, and four fish born in MPAs that dispersed to nearby MPAs. Additionally, we identified 25 full-sibling pairs, which occurred throughout the sampling area and included all possible combinations of inferred dispersal trajectories. Intriguingly, these included two pairs of young-of-the-year siblings with one member each sampled in consecutive years. These sibling pairs suggest monogamy, either intentional or accidental, which has not been previously demonstrated in rockfishes. This study provides the first direct observation of larval dispersal events in a current-dominated ecosystem and direct evidence that larvae produced within MPAs are exported both to neighbouring MPAs and to proximate areas where harvest is allowed.},

  abstract = {New Zealand pioneered marine reserves, areas in the sea protected from all direct human interference. The first reserve was proposed in 1965 and established in 1977. It has operated successfully ever since. Even one instance proves that such things are possible. All marine reserves in NZ were initially greeted by a range of objections, and widespread and often loud opposition, This is not surprising since marine reserves prohibit many existing activities and seriously challenge many general opinions. Such opposition is to be expected. Successful establishment of marine reserves in the first stage was only possible when the proponents were very persistent and had community support. It helped if they could take advantage of some special local circumstance e.g. an adjacent marine laboratory (Leigh), spectacular underwater scenery (Poor Knights), unique biogeography (Kermadecs), cultural significance (Mayor Island), or severe fishery problems (Long Bay). Careful examination of the objections to marine reserves showed that they were mostly based on misconceptions or misinformation, and can be successfully countered in the public mind by answers based on common sense arguments or well-established facts. Developing these answers, and testing them in the public arena, proved surprisingly useful in both scientific theory and practical politics. When marine reserves were established, their ecology began to change, due to the cessation of fishing and other previous manipulations. These changes were complex, often large and continued to develop for decades. The study of these changes, and a continuing comparison to fished areas provided a great deal of new scientific data showing how fishing directly and indirectly alters ecosystems. The scientific benefits of marine reserves proved so numerous that it became clear that marine reserves are as important to science as clean apparatus is to chemistry, and for the same reason. They are the controls for the uncontrolled experiment that is happening due to fishing and other human activities. The general benefits of marine reserves to society as a whole; directly to conservation, education, recreation and management, and indirectly to fisheries, tourism and coastal planning; are so important that a systematic approach to their creation is in the public interest. The experience with existing marine reserves (35 to date) is sufficient to state the principles needed for such systems: representation and Replication (of habitats and species); a geographically widespread network; and a total area sufficient to be self-sustaining. Most of the lessons from New Zealand are based on fundamental human and ecological factors and would be applicable world-wide. Other regions could by-pass the long struggle that occurred in New Zealand and move directly to creating marine reserve network systems based on our experiences and these principles. This has already started to happen in Australia and the USA.},

Results also confirm that besides attitude and behavioural control personal moral norm is a third predictor of pro-environmental behavioural intention (52\% explained variance). The MASEM also indicates that problem awareness is an important but indirect determinant of pro-environmental intention. Its impact seems to be mediated by moral and social norms, guilt and attribution processes.},

  abstract = {Large marine protected areas are increasingly being established to meet global conservation targets and promote sustainable use of resources. Although the factors affecting the performance of small-scale marine protected areas are relatively well studied, there is no such body of knowledge for large marine protected areas. We conducted a global meta-analysis to systematically investigate social, ecological, and governance characteristics of successful large marine protected areas with respect to several social and ecological outcomes. We included all large ({$>$}10,000km2), implemented ({$>$}5years of active management) marine protected areas that had sufficient data for analysis, for a total of twelve cases. We used the Social-Ecological Systems Meta-Analysis Database, and a consistent protocol for using secondary data and key informant interviews, to code proxies for fisheries, ecosystem health, and the wellbeing of user groups (mainly fishers). We tested four sets of hypotheses derived from the literature on small-scale marine protected areas and common-pool resources: (i) the attributes of species and ecosystems to be managed in the marine protected area, (ii) adherence to principles for designing small-scale marine protected areas, (iii) adherence to the design principles for common-pool resource management, and (iv) stakeholder participation. We found varying levels of support for these hypotheses. Improved fisheries were associated with older marine protected areas, and higher levels of enforcement. Declining fisheries were associated with several ecological and economic factors, including low productivity, high mobility, and high market value. High levels of participation were correlated with improvements in wellbeing and ecosystem health trends. Overall, this study constitutes an important first step in identifying factors affecting social wellbeing and ecological performance of large marine protected areas.},

  abstract = {We present results from six randomized control trials of an integrated approach to improve livelihoods among the very poor. The approach combines the transfer of a productive asset with consumption support, training, and coaching plus savings encouragement and health education and/or services. Results from the implementation of the same basic program, adapted to a wide variety of geographic and institutional contexts and with multiple implementing partners, show statistically significant cost-effective impacts on consumption (fueled mostly by increases in self-employment income) and psychosocial status of the targeted households. The impact on the poor households lasted at least a year after all implementation ended. It is possible to make sustainable improvements in the economic status of the poor with a relatively short-term intervention.
INTRODUCTION Working in six countries with an international consortium, we investigate whether a multifaceted Graduation program can help the extreme poor establish sustainable self-employment activities and generate lasting improvements in their well-being. The program targets the poorest members in a village and provides a productive asset grant, training and support, life skills coaching, temporary cash consumption support, and typically access to savings accounts and health information or services. In each country, the program was adjusted to suit different contexts and cultures, while staying true to the same overall principles. This multipronged approach is relatively expensive, but the theory of change is that the combination of these activities is necessary and sufficient to obtain a persistent impact. We do not test whether each of the program dimensions is individually necessary. Instead, we examine the ``sufficiency'' claim: A year after the conclusion of the program, and 3 years after the asset transfer, are program participants earning more income and achieving stable improvements in their well-being?
RATIONALE We conducted six randomized trials in Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru with a total of 10,495 participants. In each site, our implementing partners selected eligible villages based on being in geographies associated with extreme poverty, and then identified the poorest of the poor in these villages through a participatory wealth-ranking process. About half the eligible participants were assigned to treatment, and half to control. In three of the sites, to measure within village spillovers, we also randomized half of villages to treatment and half to control. We conducted a baseline survey on all eligible participants, as well as an endline at the end of the intervention (typically 24 months after the start of the intervention) and a second endline 1 year after the first endline. We measure impacts on consumption, food security, productive and household assets, financial inclusion, time use, income and revenues, physical health, mental health, political involvement, and women's empowerment.
RESULTS At the end of the intervention, we found statistically significant impacts on all 10 key outcomes or indices. One year after the end of the intervention, 36 months after the productive asset transfer, 8 out of 10 indices still showed statistically significant gains, and there was very little or no decline in the impact of the program on the key variables (consumption, household assets, and food security). Income and revenues were significantly higher in the treatment group in every country. Household consumption was significantly higher in every country except one (Honduras). In most countries, the (discounted) extra earnings exceeded the program cost.
CONCLUSION The Graduation program's primary goal, to substantially increase consumption of the very poor, is achieved by the conclusion of the program and maintained 1 year later. The estimated benefits are higher than the costs in five out of six sites. Although more can be learned about how to optimize the design and implementation of the program, we establish that a multifaceted approach to increasing income and well-being for the ultrapoor is sustainable and cost-effective.

Attacking the problem of extreme poverty
A persistent concern about wellintentioned efforts to improve living standards for the 1.2 billion people who survive (if it can be called that) on less than \$1.25 US per day is figuring out what works. A second concern is figuring out whether what works in one setting can be made to work in another. Banerjee et al. describe encouraging results from a set of pilot projects in Ethiopia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Pakistan, and Peru encompassing 11,000 households. Each project provided short-term aid and longer-term support to help participants graduate to a sustainable level of existence.

When citations did not mention rebuttals, 95\% accepted the thesis of the original article uncritically, and support remained high over time. On the rare occasions when rebuttals were cited, the citing papers on average had neutral views of the original article, and 8\% actually believed that the rebuttal agreed with the original article.

Here we develop and link models of physical, biological and human responses to climate change in 67 marine national exclusive economic zones, which yield approximately 60\% of global fish catches, to project climate change yield impacts in countries with different dependencies on marine fisheries. Predicted changes in fish production indicate increased productivity at high latitudes and decreased productivity at low/mid latitudes, with considerable regional variations. With few exceptions, increases and decreases in fish production potential by 2050 are estimated to be {$<$}10\% (mean +3.4\%) from present yields. Among the nations showing a high dependency on fisheries, climate change is predicted to increase productive potential in West Africa and decrease it in South and Southeast Asia. Despite projected human population increases and assuming that per capita fish consumption rates will be maintained, ongoing technological development in the aquaculture industry suggests that projected global fish demands in 2050 could be met, thus challenging existing predictions of inevitable shortfalls in fish supply by the mid-twenty-first century. This conclusion, however, is contingent on successful implementation of strategies for sustainable harvesting and effective distribution of wild fish products from nations and regions with a surplus to those with a deficit. Changes in management effectiveness and trade practices will remain the main influence on realized gains or losses in global fish production.},

To explore why, 19 local fishers were interviewed in March 2012, the majority of whom fished both snow crab (in the Box) and trawled for shrimp, (Pandalus spp.), now prohibited. All respondents indicated that the closure was beneficial to them, their community, and marine life. Respondents believed that protecting the area from trawling was the primary reason they still have a viable fishery, despite little improvement in Snow crab since the closure and their own partial exclusion. Fishers understood that reducing their own (not someone else's) fishing effort would likely enhance long-term sustainability of livelihoods. A full 94.7\% believed that fisheries and conservation are compatible goals. Closures with fishers support based on local knowledge are more likely to meet fishery and conservation goals than those that do not. Closures can become building blocks of an ecosystem based management approach that includes fishers as part of the system, meeting both international marine protection targets and fisheries production goals.},

The theoretical relationship between reproduction and body size has assumed that total mass relates directly to fecundity, regardless of the number of individuals involved. This assumption leads to fisheries management practices that suggest that one large female fish can be replaced by several smaller females. However, this assumption is incorrect. Barneche et al. show that larger females are far more productive than the same weight's worth of smaller females. Management practices that ignore the value of large females could contribute to unexplained declines seen in some fish stocks.
Science, this issue p. 642
Body size determines total reproductive-energy output. Most theories assume reproductive output is a fixed proportion of size, with respect to mass, but formal macroecological tests are lacking. Management based on that assumption risks underestimating the contribution of larger mothers to replenishment, hindering sustainable harvesting. We test this assumption in marine fishes with a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of the intraspecific mass scaling of reproductive-energy output. We show that larger mothers reproduce disproportionately more than smaller mothers in not only fecundity but also total reproductive energy. Our results reset much of the theory on how reproduction scales with size and suggest that larger mothers contribute disproportionately to population replenishment. Global change and overharvesting cause fish sizes to decline; our results provide quantitative estimates of how these declines affect fisheries and ecosystem-level productivity.

Increasingly, a new application of the classic ``checkerboard distribution'' approach is used to infer interactions by examining the pairwise frequency at which species are found to spatially co-occur. However, the link between spatial associations, as estimated from observational co-occurrence, and species interactions has not been tested. Here we used nine common statistical methods to estimate associations from surveys of rocky intertidal communities in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. We compared those inferred associations with a new data set of experimentally determined net and direct species interactions. Although association methods generated networks with aggregate structure similar to previously published interaction networks, each method detected a different set of species associations from the same data set. Moreover, although association methods generally performed better than a random model, associations rarely matched empirical net or direct species interactions, with high rates of false positives and true positives, and many false negatives. Our findings cast doubt on studies that equate species co-occurrences to species interactions and highlight a persistent, unanswered question: how do we interpret spatial patterns in communities? We suggest future research directions to unify the observational and experimental study of species interactions, and discuss the need for community standards and best practices in association analysis.},

Improved quantification of these relationships and their response to the environment is needed to parameterize food web models and describe food web structure and function. A compiled data set comprising 29{$\mkern1mu$}582 records of individual prey eaten at 21 locations by individual predators that spanned 10 orders of magnitude in mass and lived in marine environments ranging from the poles to the tropics was used to investigate the influence of predator size and environment on predator and prey size relationships. Linear mixed effects models demonstrated that predator\textendash{}prey mass ratios (PPMR) increased with predator mass. The amount of the increase varied among locations and predator species and individuals but was not significantly influenced by temperature, latitude, depth, or primary production. Increases in PPMR with predator mass implied nonlinear relationships between log body mass and trophic level and reductions in transfer efficiency with increasing body size. The results suggest that very general rules determine dominant trends in PPMR in diverse marine ecosystems, leading to the ubiquity of size-based trophic structuring and the consistency of observed relationships between the relative abundance of individuals and their body size.},

Here, we link comprehensive data on fisher's information exchange networks and economic productivity to test hypotheses about when it pays to cooperate by exchanging different types of strategic information. We find that being well connected locally in information exchange networks about both short-term topics (e.g., the location of species) and long-term topics (e.g., technical innovations) is positively associated with productivity in both the short-term (within fishing trips) and long-term (annually). In contrast, we find that exchanging both types of information across distinct social divides \textendash{} a form of brokerage \textendash{} is negatively associated with productivity. Our results therefore suggest that while there appears to be an economic benefit associated with cooperation across temporal scales in the harvest of common-pool fishery resources, exchanging strategic information across social divides may come at a cost \textendash{} particularly under conditions of competition. We discuss our results in light of emerging research at the nexus of sociology and economics, providing key insight into the social-structural dynamics that help form the foundation for fisher decision-making and behavior.},

  abstract = {Researchers have long recognized the importance of ecological differences at the species level in structuring natural communities yet until recently have often overlooked the influence of intraspecific trait variation, which can profoundly alter community dynamics [ 1 ]. Human extraction of living resources can reduce intraspecific trait variation by, for example, causing truncation of age and size structure of populations, where numbers of older individuals decline far more with exploitation than younger individuals. Age truncation can negatively affect population and community stability, increasing variability in population and community biomass [ 2\textendash{}6 ], reducing productivity [ 7\textendash{}10 ] and life-history diversity in traits such as the spatial and temporal pattern of reproduction and migration [ 4, 11\textendash{}16 ]. Here, we quantified the extent of age truncation in 63 fished populations across five ocean regions, as measured by how much the proportions of fish in the oldest age groups declined over time. The proportion of individuals in the oldest age classes decreased significantly in 79\% to 97\% of populations (compared to historical or unfished values, respectively), and the magnitude of decline was greater than 90\% in 32\% to 41\% of populations. The pervasiveness and intensity of age truncation indicates that fishing is likely reducing the stability of many marine communities. Our findings suggest that more emphasis should be given to management measures that reduce the impact of fishing on age truncation, including no-take areas, slot limits that prohibit fishing on all except a narrow range of fish sizes, and rotational harvesting.},

Drawing on a growing understanding of what contributes to successful SSF management, as well as other similar smallholder market-based instruments, this article distils a core set of recommendations for a revised ``FIP+'' approach. The `+' denotes a broader set of integrated and complimentary interventions that recognize the complex social and economic landscape inherent within SSF, and that SSF reform will not occur through simply raising fishers' income alone. In order to be successful the FIP~+~model will need to consider investing in the following: strengthening tenure and community governance; covering upfront opportunity costs; reducing fisher vulnerability to market shocks by supporting a broader livelihood portfolio; and relaxing credit, social and human constraints within the wider context of SSFs. In addition it should do so in a manner that is conditional on improving fisheries management.},

In this study we present a framework in which we integrate existing models and knowledge on basic regulatory processes to investigate the potential impact of future scenarios of fisheries exploitation and climate change on the temporal dynamics of the central Baltic herring stock. Alternative scenarios of increasing sea surface temperature and decreasing salinity of the Baltic Sea from a global climate model were combined with two alternative fishing scenarios, and their direct and ecosystem-mediated effects (i.e., through predation by cod and competition with sprat) on the herring population were evaluated for the period 2010\textendash{}2050. Gradual increase in temperature has a positive impact on the long-term productivity of the herring stock, but it has the potential to enhance the recovery of the herring stock only in combination with sustainable fisheries management (i.e., Fmsy). Conversely, projections of herring spawning stock biomass (SSB) were generally low under elevated fishing mortality levels (Fhigh), comparable with those experienced by the stock during the 1990s. Under the combined effects of long-term warming and high fishing mortality uncertainty in herring SSB projections was higher and increasing for the duration of the forecasts, suggesting a synergistic effect of fishery exploitation and climate forcing on fish populations dynamics. Our study shows that simulations of long-term fish dynamics can be an informative tool to derive expectations of the potential long-term impact of alternative future scenarios of exploitation and climate change.},

Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide effects remains a threat.},

At the beginning of each fishing season a government agency sets an allowable commercial catch. Individual firms hold an entitlement to harvest a share of the allowable commercial catch. To date, the government agency has relied almost exclusively on the results of stock assessment research when setting the allowable harvest. Excessive reliance on biological data in fisheries management has attracted criticism. An alternative, a minimum information management system, uses information contained in quota prices as a guide to set limits on commercial harvest. This paper examines price formation in one quota market. We find evidence in the data that supports the use of quota prices to guide the setting of limits to commercial harvest. Furthermore, time-series analysis provides a basis for studying the temporal response of changes in asset prices to perturbations in the allowable harvest. The results illustrate how information summarized in quota prices can complement the findings of stock assessment research in fisheries management.},

Several risk assessment methods exist that can provide a scientific basis for siting interventions and guiding management actions, but these methods focus mainly on single species and evaluate only the impacts of fishing in detail. We present a new ecosystem risk assessment model, the Comprehensive Assessment of Risk to Ecosystems (CARE), which allows analysts to consider the cumulative impact of multiple threats, interactions among threats that may result in synergistic or antagonistic impacts, and the impacts of a suite of threats on whole-ecosystem productivity and functioning, as well as on ecosystem services. CARE can be completed very rapidly, and uses local and expert knowledge where data are lacking. It can be applied to virtually any system, and can be modified as knowledge is gained or to better match different site characteristics. Two case studies are provided to illustrate how CARE can be applied. These CARE analyses suggest that in Karimunjawa, Indonesia activities other than fishing should be addressed to ensure that a fisheries intervention will achieve desired outcomes. Conversely in Cantilan, Philippines a well-designed and implemented fishery intervention could address all of the most important system threats.},

We empirically evaluated the relationship of a list of factors that have been postulated to facilitate successful scaling to the degree of scaling success achieved in 56 case studies from a variety of sectors. We identified 23 factors that are significantly associated with successful scaling, defined as self-replication: an innovation that is congruent with local sociocultural patterns, takes advantage of existing scaled infrastructure, and facilitates a paradigm shift; adequate resources and constituencies for scaling, secured from the start, drawn from both within and outside the system; pilot sites that reflect conditions at future sites rather than ideal conditions; clear and deliberate scaling expectations and strategy; capitalization on economies of scale; a project team that has a unifying vision, includes both individuals who helped design the innovation and members of the target audience, and empowers users with the requisite skills; target audiences that take ownership of the project; the provision of long-term support systems; ongoing learning about the factors influencing scaling; direct management of relevant supply and demand streams; targeted marketing and dissemination efforts; and the evaluation of scaling success indicators. We also explored correlations between these principles, and identified a group of principles that together explain nearly 40\% of the variance in success: the provision of long-term support systems (or one of its surrogates: turning users into partners, a user organization with wide reach, and the empowerment of the target audience with requisite skills); resources mobilized from within and outside the system; user organizations that have the capacity to implement the innovation; innovations that are platform solutions and that provide rapid feedback; and pilot sites that have realistic conditions relative to future sites. Our results suggest that for scaling to be successful: 1) scaling must be considered at all stages of a project; 2) the context must be managed and barriers to scaling must be identified and removed and 3) deliberate attention must be paid to scaling methods, marketing and dissemination efforts, and long-term monitoring of scaling progress.},

  abstract = {While the species level effects of marine reserves are widely recognized, community level shifts due to marine reserves have only recently been documented. Protection from fishing of top predators may lead to trophic cascades, which have community-wide implications. Disease may act in a similar manner, regulating population levels of dominant species within a community. Two decades of data from the Channel Islands National Park Service's Kelp Forest Monitoring database allowed us to compare the effects of fishing and urchin disease on rocky reef community patterns and dynamics. Different size-frequency distributions of urchins inside and outside of reserves indicated reduced predation on urchins at sites where fishing removes urchin predators. Rocky reefs inside reserves were more likely to support kelp forests than were fished areas. We suggest that this results from cascading effects of the fishery on urchin predators outside the reserves, which releases herbivores (urchins) from predation. After periods of prevalent urchin disease, the reef community shifted more towards kelp forest assemblages. Specific groups of algae and invertebrates were associated with kelp forest and barrens communities. The community dynamics leading to transitions between kelp forests and barrens are driven by both fishing and disease; however the fishery effect was of greater magnitude. This study further confirms the importance of marine reserves not only for fisheries conservation, but also for the conservation of historically dominant community types.},

The method incorporates flexibility to allow for sampling difficulties encountered in real field experiments, such as unequal sampling intervals and incomplete sampling of the gear. A short-term mark-recapture experiment is described, aimed at estimating density of edible crabs, Cancer pagurus, on an offshore bank off the English east coast. More than 3000 crabs were marked with paint and sampled using baited traps of standard commercial design. We apply the mark-recapture model to estimate probabilities of capture and fidelity to the experimental capture area, and thereby estimate the size of the local population from the total catch data. A local population of 4800 crabs is estimated to exist in a capture area of 2.3 km2, giving an estimated density of 2100 crabs/km2. Bootstrapping is used to show that temporal variation is much more important than spatial variation as a component of uncertainty in density estimates. Experimental catch data are used to draw inferences about the relationship between trap soak time and effective fishing effort. Density estimates are shown to be robust to uncertainty about this relationship. Problems of interpretation of density estimates at the population level are discussed.},

Using random sampling techniques, we estimated the uncertainty surrounding many of our estimates enabling the identification of deficiencies and limitations. Global fishing capacity and effort increased rapidly from the late 1970s through to around 2010 before stabilizing. The Asian fleet is more than an order of magnitude larger than any other region in both capacity and effort, and continues to increase. Most other regions have stabilized, and there have been considerable declines in Europe and, to a lesser extent, in North America. Developed nations, as a whole, have decreased in both measures in the recent years and are responsible for the stabilization of the global trend. Developing and undeveloped countries are still increasing with the former having the largest fleet and showing the greatest relative increase with the socioeconomic impacts of reversing these trends likely to be high. The efficiency of the global fleet, in terms of watt days of fishing effort per tonnage of wild marine catch, is now less than in 1950 despite the considerable technological advances, and expansion throughout the world's oceans, that has occurred during this period of time.},

  abstract = {Quota allocation mechanisms have distributional effects that are highly relevant to the economic organization of fisheries. In France, where fishing allocations are non-transferable, quotas are shared among Producer Organizations (POs) based on the historical landings of their members. Each PO is then responsible for implementing their own internal rules that provide individual or collective allocations to their members. This study investigates the distributional effects of the various quota management systems adopted by POs on quotas and production for the Bay of Biscay sole fishery. A comparison between initial allocations by vessel based on historical landings and actual observed landings is presented. Inequality metrics are used to quantify distributional effects, and a new method that is based on the decomposability property of the Theil index is introduced. Results show that the French management system successfully avoided concentration of production while reducing the fishing capacity through decommissioning schemes. The non-transferability of fishing allocations is a critical element that favored this outcome by allowing POs to control the distribution of catch shares in the fishery. Besides, it appears that the allocation strategies developed by POs were notably influenced by their local roots and their fishing fleet profiles. The various quota allocation systems among POs had contrasting effects on vessels' production, including greater equity within particular subfleets, benefits to vessels most dependent on sole in most POs, and benefits to the small-scale fisheries in a few POs.},

  abstract = {In complex dynamic systems like fisheries, recognizing fishing-effort responses is as critical as understanding the biology of the exploited species for making sensible management decisions. In highly seasonal fisheries, it is theoretically possible for an ``interannual bionomic equilibrium'' to develop under open-access, where fleet dynamics may result in balanced year-to-year harvesting due to decreasing income per time fishing as biomass declines, without endangering the sustainability of the stock. However, in some conditions, this interannual bionomic equilibrium can be pathologically low leading to overfishing and amplification of extinction risks. Here we draw three cases from short-lived and fast-growing invertebrate fisheries to illustrate two distinct effort response dynamics: (a) fishing-effort responses that lead to healthy interannual bionomic equilibrium; and (b) fishing-effort responses in which fishing remains profitable over the entire season, hence, allowing fishing fleets to maintain a high fishing-effort throughout the season. Analyzing long-term within-year catch and effort data, we found that both Gulf of Mexico shrimp and North Territory giant crab fisheries are likely currently at healthy interannual bionomic equilibria, while certain socioeconomic drivers enable the Kuwait shrimp fishery to maintain high effort through the entire shrimping season. Our findings suggest that input controls are less effective in short-lived invertebrate fisheries that exhibit fishing-effort proportional to declining stock abundance. Conversely, if not regulated, the abundance-insensitive fishing-effort response could pose biological risks and habitat destruction. Therefore, we emphasize that in common-property seasonal fisheries, fishing-effort responses be scrutinized to distinguish factors that might undermine resource sustainability.},

The latter mechanism involves targeting species with biological traits including fast growth, high natural mortality and short lifespans; these fisheries have been expanding rapidly over the last forty years, gaining social and economic importance. In this paper, we underscore the biological and economic dynamics of these fisheries by developing an intraseasonal bioeconomic model to examine the profitability under two situations: open-access and limited entry. We also incorporate the opportunity cost\textemdash{}the earnings that would result from pursuing other lines of work\textemdash{}in our modeling framework. We show that under limited entry situation, profitability is maximized over a given season\textemdash{}when income just balances operating cost per effort. Under open-access, however, net profit per vessel is driven down until it equals the opportunity cost. Biologically, our approach suggests that higher income from alternatives to fishing leads to less biomass depletion than would occur if there were no alternative income sources. To conclude, we discuss several traditional regulatory options and their effects on the distribution of fishing effort and season length.},

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are effective conservation and fisheries management tools that can also have a broad array of positive and negative social, economic, cultural, and political impacts on local communities. Drawing on results from a mixed-methods study of communities on the Andaman Coast of Thailand, this paper explores perceptions of MPA impacts on community livelihood resources (assets) and outcomes as well as MPA governance and management. The area includes 17 National Marine Parks (NMPs) that are situated near rural communities that are highly dependent on coastal resources. Interview participants perceived NMPs to have limited to negative impacts on fisheries and agricultural livelihoods and negligible benefits for tourism livelihoods. Perceived impacts on livelihoods were felt to result from NMPs undermining access to or lacking support for development of cultural, social, political, financial, natural, human, physical, and political capital assets. Conflicting views emerged on whether NMPs resulted in negative or positive marine or terrestrial conservation outcomes. Perceptions of NMP governance and management processes were generally negative. These results point to some necessary policy improvements and actions to ameliorate: the relationship between the NMP and communities, NMP management and governance processes, and socio-economic and conservation outcomes.},

  abstract = {Summary
The expansion of global seafood trade creates opportunities as well as risks for small-scale fisheries (SSFs) livelihoods. Markets provide economic opportunity, but without effective governance, high demand can drive resource degradation. In the context of small-scale sea cucumber fisheries in Yucat{\'a}n, Mexico, this study documents local governance responses to new markets and identifies factors driving those responses. We conducted a comparative case study of two SSF communities, collecting participant observation and interview data during 16months of fieldwork. Our study found that local rules-in-use did not match government regulations and that the emergence of local rules was shaped by relations of production in each study site. Specifically, patron\textendash{}client relationships promoted an open access regime that expanded local fishing fleets while fishing cooperatives attempted to restrict access to local fishing grounds through collective action and multi-level linkages with government. We propose that the different material incentives arising from the way that patron\textendash{}client relationships and cooperatives organize labor, capital, and profits help explain these divergent governance responses. We hypothesize that this finding is generalizable beyond the study context, especially given that patron\textendash{}client relationships and cooperatives are common throughout the world's SSFs. This finding builds on previous research that indicates local institutions can mediate the effects of market pressures, showing that the emergence of local rules depends on how resource users are organized not just in relation to resource governance but vis-{\`a}-vis the markets themselves. Therefore, effective policies for SSFs facing market pressures require a greater emphasis on regulating local-level trade and governing the commercial aspects of fishing livelihoods. These lessons are relevant to the estimated 540 million individuals whose livelihoods SSFs support who may increasingly engage in the global seafood trade.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerous groundfish stocks in both the Atlantic and Pacific are considered overfished, resulting in large-scale fishery closures. Fishing, in addition to simply removing biomass, also truncates the age and size structure of fish populations and often results in localized depletions. We summarize recent research suggesting that an old-growth age structure, combined with a broad spatial distribution of spawning and recruitment, is at least as important as spawning biomass in maintaining long-term sustainable population levels. In particular, there is evidence that older, larger female rockfishes produce larvae that withstand starvation longer and grow faster than the offspring of younger fish, that stocks may actually consist of several reproductively isolated units, and that recruitment may come from only a small and different fraction of the spawning population each year. None of these phenomena is accounted for in current management programs. We examine alternative management measures that address these specific issues and conclude that the best and perhaps only way to ensure old-growth age structure and complex spatial structure in populations of groundfish is through interconnected networks of marine reserves.},

In a randomized experimental design with over 100,000 households, we study the longer-term impacts of a one-time behavioral nudge that aimed to induce voluntary reductions in water use during a drought. Combining technical information, moral suasion, and social comparisons, the nudge has a surprisingly persistent effect. Although its effect size declines by almost 50\% after 1 year, it remains detectable and policy-relevant six years later. In fact, the total reduction in water use achieved after the 4-month period targeted by the intervention is larger than the total reduction achieved during the target period. Further analysis suggests that the intervention works through both short-lived behavioral adjustments and longer-lived adjustments to habits or physical capital. Treatment effects are not detectable in homes from which the treated consumers have moved, which provides suggestive evidence that these longer-lived adjustments are mobile rather than incorporated into the housing stock. The persistence of the effect makes the intervention more cost-effective than previously assumed (cost drops by almost 60\%). Nevertheless, water utilities may find this persistence undesirable if the nudges are intended to have only a short-run effect on demand during environmental emergencies.},

For each law, we use OLS to compute the DD estimate of its ``effect'' as well as the standard error of this estimate.

Econometric corrections that place a specific parametric form on the time-series process do not perform well.

Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of states and one correction that collapses the time series information into a ``pre''- and ``post''-period and explicitly takes into account the effective sample size works well even for small numbers of states.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}br/{$>$}The Peruvian anchovy or anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) supports the highest worldwide fishery landings and varies in space and time over many scales. Here we present the first comprehensive sub-mesocale study of anchoveta distribution in relation to the environment. During November 2004, we conducted a behavioural ecology survey off central Peru and used a series of observational and sampling tools including SST and CO2 sensors, Niskin bottles, CTD probes, zooplankton sampling, stomach content analysis, echo-sounder, multibeam sonar, and bird observations. The sub-mesoscale survey areas were chosen from mesoscale acoustic surveys. A routine coast-wide (\textasciitilde{}2000~km) acoustic survey performed just after the sub-mesoscale surveys, provided information at an even larger population scale. The availability of nearly concurrent sub-mesoscale, mesoscale and coast-wide information on anchoveta distribution allowed for a unique multi-scale synthesis. At the sub-mesoscale (100s m to km) physical processes (internal waves and frontogenesis) concentrated plankton into patches and determined anchoveta spatial distribution. At the mesoscale (10s km) location relative to the zone of active upwelling (and age of the upwelled water) and the depth of the oxycline had strong impacts on the anchoveta. Finally, over 100s km the size of the productive area, as defined by the upwelled cold coastal waters, was the determining factor. We propose a conceptual view of the relative importance of social behaviour and environmental (biotic and abiotic) processes on the spatial distribution of anchoveta. Our ecological space has two y-axis; one based on self-organization (social behaviour), and the other based on the environmental processes. At scales from the individual (10s cm), to the nucleus (m), social behaviour (e.g. the need to school) drives spatial organization. At scales larger than the school, environmental forces are the main driver of fish distribution. The conceptual ecosystem models presented in this paper may provide the final links needed to develop accurate forecasts of the spatial distribution of anchoveta over multiple scales.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Individual MPAs must produce sufficient larvae that settle within that reserve's boundaries to maintain local populations while simultaneously supplying larvae to other MPA nodes in the network that might otherwise suffer local extinction. Here, we use genetic parentage analysis to demonstrate that patterns of self-recruitment of two reef fishes (Amphiprion percula and Chaetodon vagabundus) in an MPA in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, were remarkably consistent over several years. However, dispersal from this reserve to two other nodes in an MPA network varied between species and through time. The stability of our estimates of self-recruitment suggests that even small MPAs may be self-sustaining. However, our results caution against applying optimization strategies to MPA network design without accounting for variable connectivity among species and over time.},

  abstract = {* Integrated population modelling is proving to be an important and useful technique in statistical ecology. However, there is currently no simple formal method for judging how well models fit data, when potentially several different data sets described by different structured models are being analysed in combination.

* We propose and evaluate a new approach, of calibrated simulation. Here, comparative data sets are obtained from simulating data when model parameter values are obtained from the assumed asymptotic normal distribution of the maximum-likelihood estimators from the real data. The approach is motivated and justified by Bayesian P-values. Calibration of the resulting statistics is achieved as repeated data sets are easily simulated from the fitted model. The method requires the specification of model discrepancy measures, and we show how different measures can highlight different aspects of fit.

* Calibration is only strictly necessary if the statistics proposed may appear to be extreme.

* The approach of using calibrated simulation to check the goodness-of-fit of integrated population models is demonstrated by application to data sets on lapwings and herons. In each case, there are two data sets involved in the integrated analysis, and for each component data set, discrepancy measures of goodness-of-fit are obtained. For the lapwing application, as replication is efficient, it is possible to calibrate the procedure simply by using additional simulations. The heron application is shown to be feasible, but is substantially harder to calibrate, due to the presence of productivity thresholds that need to be estimated using profile likelihood methods. We demonstrate the importance of taking more than one discrepancy measure for time-series data. Avenues for future research are outlined. This article has supplementary materials on line.},

As well as living in the conventional habitats of lakes, ponds, rivers, rock pools and the open sea, fish have solved the problems of life in deserts, in the deep sea, in the cold antarctic, and in warm waters of high alkalinity or of low oxygen. Along with these adaptations, we find the most impressive specializations of morphology, physiology and behaviour. For example we can marvel at the high-speed swimming of the marlins, sailfish and warm-blooded tunas, air-breathing in catfish and lungfish, parental care in the mouth-brooding cichlids, and viviparity in many sharks and toothcarps. Moreover, fish are of considerable importance to the survival of the human species in the form of nutritious, delicious and diverse food. Rational exploitation and management of our global stocks of fishes must rely upon a detailed and precise insight of their biology. The Chapman \& Hall Fish and Fisheries Series aims to present timely volumes reviewing important aspects of fish biology. Most volumes will be of interest to research workers in biology, zoology, ecology and physiology but an additional aim is for the books to be accessible to a wide spectrum of non-specialist readers ranging from undergraduates and postgraduates to those with an interest in industrial and commercial aspects of fish and fisheries.},

We use Modern Portfolio Theory to identify coral reef locations globally that, in the absence of other impacts, are likely to have a heightened chance of surviving projected climate changes relative to other reefs. Long-term planning that is robust to uncertainty in future conditions provides an objective and transparent framework for guiding conservation action and strategic investment. These locations constitute important opportunities for novel conservation investments to secure less vulnerable yet well-connected coral reefs that may, in turn, help to repopulate degraded areas in the event that the climate has stabilized.},

  abstract = {A new habitat-based model is developed to improve estimates of relative abundance of Pacific bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). The model provides estimates of `effective' longline effort and therefore better estimates of catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) by incorporating information on the variation in longline fishing depth and depth of bigeye tuna preferred habitat. The essential elements in the model are: (1) estimation of the depth distribution of the longline gear, using information on gear configuration and ocean currents; (2) estimation of the depth distribution of bigeye tuna, based on habitat preference and oceanographic data; (3) estimation of effective longline effort, using fine-scale Japanese longline fishery data; and (4) aggregation of catch and effective effort over appropriate spatial zones to produce revised time series of CPUE. Model results indicate that effective effort has increased in both the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) and eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). In the WCPO, effective effort increased by 43\% from the late 1960s to the late 1980s due primarily to the increased effectiveness of effort (deeper longline sets) rather than to increased nominal effort. Over the same period, effective effort increased 250\% in the EPO due primarily to increased nominal effort. Nominal and standardized CPUE indices in the EPO show similar trends \textendash{} a decline during the 1960s, a period of stability in the 1970s, high values during 1985\textendash{}1986 and a decline thereafter. In the WCPO, nominal CPUE is stable over the time-series; however, standardized CPUE has declined by {$\sim$}50\%. If estimates of standardized CPUE accurately reflect relative abundance, then we have documented substantial reductions of bigeye tuna abundance for some regions in the Pacific Ocean. A decline in standardized CPUE in the subtropical gyres concurrent with stability in equatorial areas may represent a contraction in the range of the population resulting from a decline in population abundance. The sensitivity of the results to the habitat (temperature and oxygen) assumptions was tested using Monte Carlo simulations.},

A critical question, however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or shoreline development (only gradual restoration is possible). The model represents key features of a broad class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers can only be manipulated gradually management action is needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated, often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is also dependent on developing policy processes that enable society to respond more rapidly to information about impending regime shifts.},

Catch shares are hypothesized to halt the race by securing each individual's right to a portion of the total catch, but there is evidence for this from selected examples only2,9. Here we systematically analyse natural experiments to test whether catch shares reduce racing in 39 US fisheries. We compare each fishery treated with catch shares to an individually matched control before and after the policy change. We estimate an average policy treatment effect in a pooled model and in a meta-analysis that combines separate estimates for each treatment\textendash{}control pair. Consistent with the theory that market-based management ends the race to fish, we find strong evidence that catch shares extend fishing seasons. This evidence informs the current debate over expanding the use of market-based regulation to other fisheries.},

Interest in the concept of marine PES has recently emerged, but the fluid, transboundary and often common pool nature of marine ecosystems presents challenges for PES design and implementation. Here, we consider the potential role of PES in addressing current gaps in fisheries management. Used in combination with conventional regulatory approaches, PES may increase private sector engagement and generate more sustainable financing for fisheries management whilst spreading accountability throughout the supply chain. The approach is most likely to be feasible and effective in commercially valuable fisheries with: (i) demand for one or more ecosystem service and a threat to supply; (ii) suitable baseline data available and potential management actions underpinned by robust science; (iii) clarity and security of property rights; (iv) capacity for hybrid multi-level governance; (v) capacity for rigorous monitoring, control and surveillance; and (vi) potential for financial sustainability of the scheme. An examination of four contrasting fisheries \textendash{} Namibian hake, Mozambican shallow-water shrimp, Western and Central Pacific skipjack tuna and Bangladesh hilsa \textendash{} demonstrates that a developing world fishery will rarely fulfil each of these preconditions a priori, but that the potential for successful application of PES still exists. In practice, PES design will depend on the institutional context and require creative and innovative approaches to the maintenance of conditionality and additionality.},

Trend analysis of indicators: a comparison of recent changes in the status of marine ecosystems around the world. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 732\textendash{}744. Time-series of ecological and exploitation indicators collected from 19 ecosystems were analysed to investigate whether there have been temporal trends in the status of fish communities. Using linear and non-linear statistical methods, trends are reported for six indicators (mean length of fish in the community, mean lifespan, proportion of predatory fish, total biomass of surveyed species, mean trophic level of landings, and inverse fishing pressure), and the redundancy of these indicators across ecosystems is evaluated. The expected direction of change for an ecosystem that is increasingly impacted by fishing is a decline in all indicators. A mixture of negative and positive directions of change is recorded, both within and among all ecosystems considered. No consistent patterns in the redundancy of the ecological indicators across ecosystems emerged from the analyses, confirming that each indicator provided complementary information on ecosystem status. The different trends in indicators may reflect differing historical exploitation patterns, management, and environmental regimes in these systems. Commitment to monitoring programmes and development of system-specific baseline, target, and threshold reference levels are required. Improved understanding of the responsiveness and performance of ecological indicators to management actions are needed to address adequately whether ecosystems are recovering from, or being further impacted by, fishing, and whether management targets are being met. The relative effects of multiple environmental and ecological processes as well as multiple human-induced stressors that characterize exploited ecosystems also need to be quantified.},

For example, in Europe, targets for (i) biodiversity, (ii) food web structure as indicated by the proportion of large fish and (iii) fishing mortality rates for exploited species that lead to maximum sustainable yield, FMSY, are being proposed to support implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Efforts to reconcile any trade-offs among objectives need to be informed by knowledge on the consequences of alternate management actions.

* We develop, calibrate and apply a multispecies size spectrum model of the North Sea fish community to assess the response of populations and the community to fishing. The model predicts species' size distributions, abundance, productivity and interactions and therefore provides a single framework for evaluating trade-offs between population status, community and food web structure, biodiversity and fisheries yield.

* We show that the model can replicate realistic fish population and community structure and past responses to fishing. We assess whether meeting management targets for exploited North Sea populations (fishing species at FMSY) will be sufficient to meet proposed targets for biodiversity and food web indicators under two management scenarios (status quo and FMSY).

* The recovery in biodiversity indicators is 60\% greater when fishing populations at FMSY than if status quo (2010) fishing rates are maintained. The probability of achieving a food web target was 60\% under both scenarios in spite of major community restructuring revealed by other indicators of community size structure.

* Synthesis and applications. Our model can be applied to evaluate indicator targets and trade-offs among fisheries and conservation objectives. There is a significant probability that reductions in fishing mortality below FMSY would be needed in Europe if managers make a binding commitment to a proposed large fish indicator target, with concomitant reductions in fisheries yield.},

Implemented for diverse objectives from stock rebuilding to biodiversity protection and ecosystem management, spatial measures range from temporary fisheries closures to marine protected areas with varying levels of protection. Ecological and economic benefits from spatial protection have been demonstrated for many reef and demersal species, but remain debated and understudied for highly migratory fishes, such as tunas, billfishes, and pelagic sharks. Here we summarize the spatial extent of fisheries closures implemented by the tuna RFMOs as well as marine protected areas worldwide, which together cover {$\sim$}15\% of global ocean area. We furthermore synthesize results from modeling and tagging studies as well as fisheries-dependent research to provide an overview of the efficacy and benefits of present spatial protection measures for large pelagic fishes and their associated fisheries. We conclude that (1) many species with known migration routes, aggregating behavior, and philopatry can benefit from spatial protection; but (2) spatial protection alone is insufficient and should be integrated with effective fisheries management to protect and rebuild stocks of highly migratory species. We suggest tailoring spatial protection to the biology of large pelagic fishes, including improved protection for aggregation sites and migration corridors. These features currently appear to be an important\textemdash{}yet overlooked\textemdash{} opportunity to safeguard depleted and recovering stocks and protect pelagic biodiversity. New remote-sensing tools that track pelagic fishes and fishing vessels may provide timely support for improved spatial management in waters that were previously difficult to observe.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-based management requires integration of multiple system components and uses, identifying and striving for sustainable outcomes, precaution in avoiding deleterious actions, and adaptation based on experience to achieve effective solutions. Efforts underway or in planning to restore and manage two major coastal ecosystems, the Chesapeake Bay (Chesapeake Bay Program) and coastal Louisiana (Louisiana Coastal Area Plan and Gulf Hypoxia Action Plan), are examined with respect to these four principles. These multifaceted restoration programs represent among the foremost challenges for science and coastal management in the United States and, thereby, have important implications for addressing the coastal environmental crises being experienced throughout the world. Although frameworks exist for integration of management objectives in both regions, the technical ability for the quantitatively integrated assessment of multiple stressors and strategies is still in an early stage of development. Science is also being challenged to identify sustainable futures, but emerging concepts of ecosystem resilience offer some promising approaches. Precautionary management is best conceived with regard to fisheries, but should become a more explicit consideration for managing risks and avoiding unanticipated consequences of restoration activities. Adaptive management is embraced as a central process in coastal Louisiana ecosystem restoration, but has not formally been implemented in the more mature Chesapeake Bay restoration. Based on these experiences, ecosystem-based management could be advanced by: (1) orienting more scientific activity to providing the solutions needed for ecosystem restoration; (2) building bridges crossing scientific and management barriers to more effectively integrate science and management; (3) directing more attention to understanding and predicting achievable restoration outcomes that consider possible state changes and ecosystem resilience; (4) improving the capacity of science to characterize and effectively communicate uncertainty; and (5) fully integrating modeling, observations, and research to facilitate more adaptive management.},

Limited but growing research has shown beneficial biological and economic effects of marine reserves on fisheries. More research is needed, especially at larger scales, to determine the ideal marine reserve size, number and location necessary to optimize fisheries productivity and resource conservation. Sufficient evidence is available to justify the expanded use of marine reserves in an adaptive approach to fisheries management.},

  abstract = {The development of parentage analysis to track the dispersal of juvenile offspring has given us unprecedented insight into the population dynamics of coral reef fishes. These tools now have the potential to inform fisheries management and species conservation, particularly for small fragmented populations under threat from exploitation and disturbance. In this study, we resolve patterns of larval dispersal for a population of the anemonefish Amphiprion melanopus in the Keppel Islands (southern Great Barrier Reef). Habitat loss and fishing appear to have impacted this population and a network of no-take marine reserves currently protects 75\% of the potential breeders. Using parentage analysis, we estimate that 21\% of recruitment in the island group was generated locally and that breeding adults living in reserves were responsible for 79\% (31 of 39) of these of locally produced juveniles. Overall, the network of reserves was fully connected via larval dispersal; however, one reserve was identified as a critical source of larvae for the island group. The population in the Keppel Islands also appears to be well-connected to other source populations at least 60~km away, given that 79\% (145 of 184) of the juveniles sampled remained unassigned in the parentage analysis. We estimated the effective size of the A.~melanopus metapopulation to be 745 (582\textendash{}993 95\% CI) and recommend continued monitoring of its genetic status. Maintaining connectivity with populations beyond the Keppel Islands and recovery of local recruitment habitat, potentially through active restoration of host anemone populations, will be important for its long-term persistence.},

These models are used in fisheries stock assessment as a firsthand tool for the elaboration of harvesting strategies. We derive conditions on the environmental noise distribution that insure that the biomass process for an SPM has a stationary distribution, so that extinction is avoided. Explicit results about the stationary behavior of the biomass distribution are provided for a particular specification of the noise. The consideration of random noise in the MSY calculations leads to more conservative harvesting target than deterministic models. The derivations account for a possible noise autocorrelation that represents the occurrence of spells of good and bad years. The impact of the noise is found to be more severe on Pella Tomlinson model for which the asymmetry parameter p is large while it is less important for Fox model.},

This paper presents the results of a two-year long elicitation phase which aimed to explain why the use of tools in water management is not as great as the corresponding investment in applied research in this area might suggest it should be. The paper identifies a gap between water managers and research community that is evidence of a mutual misunderstanding of the fundamental activities of both communities. We elaborate on these misunderstandings between these two communities by focussing on their attitudes towards seven assumptions that derived from an elicitation phase carried out between 2003 and 2004. These misunderstandings appear to revolve around the issues of the role and importance of model-based tools in water management; the transferability of models to new target sites; the role of participatory modelling in water management; how to solve lack of confidence in model-based tools; the development of computer user interfaces to improve tool usability; and the nature of model integration. Based on these insights, recommendations for improving research, development and ultimately the use of model-based tools in river basin management processes are proposed. The recommendations include improving researchers' understanding of water management processes and the role their tools play within such a process; identifying for both communities the importance that such tools can play as part of social learning-oriented management processes; improving the role of software consultancies as carriers of research results; considering new methods of model transferability between target basins; and expanding the structure of funding for academic research and development projects to allow the greater provision of non-technical requirements such as post-development tool maintenance and transferability, required by water managers.},

Here, we analyze the changes associated with direct and indirect use of freshwater and land for meat and milk production in three production systems in Kenya between the 1980s and 2000s. We use two resource use indicators, the water footprint (m3/year) and land footprint (ha), to assess changes in freshwater and land use for cattle, goats, sheep and camels in arid, semi-arid and humid production systems. We estimate actual water and land use using Kenya-wide data for yields, feed composition and feed conversion efficiencies. Our results show that the amounts of freshwater and land resources used for production are determined mainly by production volumes and feed conversion efficiencies. Total water and land footprints of milk production increased for goats, sheep and camels but decreased by half for cattle in arid and semi-arid production systems, in correspondence with similar changes in the total numbers of each livestock species. Green water and grazing land footprints dominated in all production systems due to the predominance of indirect use of water to support forage production. The per unit meat footprint for cattle increased significantly between the 1980s and 2000s in all production systems, due to adverse trends in feed conversion efficiency, while changes in the water and land footprints of other animal products were small, due to modest changes in all influencing factors. In contrast, national average footprints per unit of beef and milk show a modest decrease due to a relative shift of production to the more resource-efficient humid production system. Given the potential increase in demand for livestock products and limited freshwater and land availability, feed conversion efficiencies should be improved by rehabilitating degraded rangelands, adopting improved breeds and using appropriate feed composition.},

This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis of two real case temporary NTZs closed during a 5\textendash{}6 year period in the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea, using scenario analysis to account for uncertainty in both the biological and economic effects. A sensitivity analysis was added for certain key parameters. The results of the cost-benefit analyses for the two NTZs are positive in all scenarios relating to the most realistic case of no opportunity costs, i.e., assuming that all fishing activity could be relocated to adjacent areas without cost during the closed period. As an extreme case comparison, full opportunity costs were included, assuming that no fishing activity could be relocated to other areas during the closed period. One of the NTZs then exhibited a negative net result for most scenarios. For the other area the net result was positive even when the maximum opportunity costs of temporary lost fishing opportunities were included, largely depending on the strong positive change in the value of commercial fishing. By demonstrating potential costs and benefits of using temporary no-take zones in fisheries management this study may contribute to policy making, as well as to creating acceptance from stakeholder groups that incur short-term costs from closing areas to fishing.},

  abstract = {Studies of recruitment to Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) and red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) populations have focused on recruitment variability on interannual, 1000-km scales. These studies have identified correlations between recruitment and variables indicating ENSO conditions and wind-forced larval transport. On longer scales, our understanding of biologically important physical variability in the California Current has recently been enhanced by an appreciation of semi-basin, decadal changes. Intensification of the Aleutian low-pressure zone in the mid-1970s had a clear positive effect of biological productivity in the Gulf of Alaska, and less obvious negative effects on productivity in the California Current. On shorter scales, an increasing appreciation of the effect of dispersal patterns on population dynamics and the potential of spatially explicit management schemes provide the impetus for studying processes such as alongshore spatial variability in recruitment and the underlying daily variability in circulation over 100-km distances. In the 1980s, physical studies of coastal circulation in response to daily fluctuations in upwelling winds identified brief periods of northward, onshore flow interrupting the offshore, southward flows associated with active upwelling. In the 1990s, concurrent monitoring of biological and physical conditions revealed that these flows transport late-stage invertebrate larvae from a retention zone in the lee of a local promontory to settlement locations, producing specific spatial patterns of recruitment. Variability in recruitment of both crabs and sea urchins is thus driven by daily temporal variability in upwelling winds and 100-km spatial variability in coastal topography. Interannual recruitment variability appears to depend on ENSO-related biological productivity and larval transport in ways that vary among species, but are not completely understood. Observations are consistent with coastwide, interannual variability being driven by biological productivity (i.e. ENSO/non-ENSO conditions), while the upwelling relaxation mechanism sets the spatial scale, and decadal, semi-basin variability modulates the frequency of ENSO conditions.},

For both of these goals, there is a need for general principles on which to base marine reserve design, and because of the paucity of empirical experience, these principles must be based on models. However, most of the theoretical studies to date have been specific to a single situation, with few attempts to deduce general principles. Here we attempt to distill existing results into general principles useful to designers of marine reserves. To answer the question of how fishery management using reserves compares to conventional management, we provide two principles: (1) the effect of reserves on yield per recruit is similar to increasing the age of first capture, and (2) the effect of reserves on yield is similar to reducing effort. Another two principles answer the question of how to design reserve configurations so that species with movement in various stages will be sustainable: (3) higher juvenile and adult movement lowers sustainability of reserves for biodiversity, but an intermediate level of adult movement is required for reserves for fishery management, and (4) longer larval dispersal distance requires larger reserves for sustainability. These principles provide general guidelines for design, and attention to them will allow more rapid progress in future modeling studies. Whether populations or communities will persist under any specific reserve design is uncertain, and we suggest ways of dealing with that uncertainty.},

  abstract = {A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.},

Many of these forecasts use ecosystem models rather than age-structured population models to describe upper trophic level (UTL) species. We illustrate the potential effects of climate on age-structured populations, then illustrate the ways in which ecosystem models might not depict adequately: (i) long-term changes in abundance, and (ii) variability attributable to cohort resonance. We simulated two generic species with different life histories, a short-lived semelparous species (e.g. salmon), and a long-lived iteroparous species (e.g. cod). For both species, juvenile survival was varied, first with white noise, then with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation as environmental signals. Variability in recruitment increased with fishing and became particularly sensitive to forcing at time-scales near the mean age of reproduction, consistent with the cohort resonance effect. Ecosystem models without age structure do not predict this behaviour, particularly when the ecosystem model incorrectly predicts the effective steepness of the stock\textendash{} recruitment relationship, or the age structure is approximated by a stage-structured model. We suggest that ecosystem models of UTLs include full representations of age structure, fitted to available population data.},

The first process focused on the Channel Islands, and the second addressed California's entire coastline, pursuant to the state's Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA). We review the interaction between science and policy in both processes, and lessons learned. For the Channel Islands, scientists controversially recommended setting aside 30\textendash{}50\% of coastline to protect marine ecosystems. For the MLPA, MPAs were intended to be ecologically connected in a network, so design guidelines included minimum size and maximum spacing of MPAs (based roughly on fish movement rates), an approach that also implicitly specified a minimum fraction of the coastline to be protected. As MPA science developed during the California processes, spatial population models were constructed to quantify how MPAs were affected by adult fish movement and larval dispersal, i.e., how population persistence within MPA networks depended on fishing outside the MPAs, and how fishery yields could either increase or decrease with MPA implementation, depending on fishery management. These newer quantitative methods added to, but did not supplant, the initial rule-of-thumb guidelines. In the future, similar spatial population models will allow more comprehensive evaluation of the integrated effects of MPAs and conventional fisheries management. By 2011, California had implemented 132 MPAs covering more than 15\% of its coastline, and now stands on the threshold of the most challenging step in this effort: monitoring and adaptive management to ensure ecosystem sustainability.},

Global production of crustaceans (18\% yr-1), molluscs (7.4\%), and seaweed (8\%) increased rapidly during the 1970\textendash{}2006 period. Scenarios indicate that annual nutrient release from all shellfish (crustaceans, bivalves, and gastropods) aquaculture will rapidly grow from 0.4 to up to 1.7 million tonnes of nitrogen and from 0.01 to 0.3 million tonnes of phosphorus between 2006 and 2050. The nitrogen and phosphorus releases from global freshwater shellfish aquaculture will increase from 1\% of river export in 2006 to up to 6\% in 2050. Marine shellfish production is an important contributor to nutrient loading of coastal seas, particularly in Eastern Asia. Nitrogen (7\% of marine aquaculture + river export in 2006 and up to 19\% in 2050) and phosphorus (12\% in 2006 and up to 30\% in 2050) releases from Chinese marine shellfish aquaculture are important and growing contributors to total nutrient inputs to coastal seas. Production of crustaceans and bivalves causes changes in nutrient stoichiometry and increasing reduced and organic nitrogen forms, which are of concern because of their preferential use by some harmful algae. Nutrient withdrawal by seaweed is projected to increase rapidly over the coming decades.

  abstract = {A global model is used to calculate feed and nutrient budgets for freshwater and marine omnivorous and carnivorous aquacultural finfish production. The model uses national production data for the period 1970\textendash{}2010 and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios for production and management for 2010\textendash{}2050. Results indicate that annual nutrient release to the freshwater (1.2 million tonnes of N and 0.1 million tonnes of P in 2010) and marine aquatic environments (0.3 million tonnes of N and 0.05 million tonnes of P) increased less rapidly than fish production, mainly due to improving feed conversion. In the coming five decades, annual nutrient release to freshwater environments may increase to 1.5\textendash{}2.1 million tonnes of N and 0.1\textendash{}0.2 million tonnes of P, depending on the production scenario and assumptions on feed conversion and the share of integrated aquacultural production. At present, the global contribution of freshwater aquaculture to nutrient loading of rivers is small. This is the same conclusion reached for the assessment of nutrient export from shellfish aquaculture (Bouwman et al., 2011). However, particularly in Asia, nutrient loading from freshwater fish production and from seaweed and shellfish production is an important factor that should be accounted for when developing models for estimating river nutrient export. Compared to chicken meat and egg production, freshwater aquaculture is a rapidly growing and important cause of the anthropogenic acceleration of the N and P cycles in many parts of the world, and this is especially pronounced in Asia.},

Here we model the impacts of a parrotfish fishery on the future state and resilience of Caribbean coral reefs, enabling us to view the tradeoff between harvest and ecosystem health. We find that the implementation of a simple and enforceable size restriction of {$>$}30 cm provides a win:win outcome in the short term, delivering both ecological and fisheries benefits and leading to increased yield and greater coral recovery rate for a given harvest rate. However, maintaining resilient coral reefs even until 2030 requires the addition of harvest limitations ({$<$}10\% of virgin fishable biomass) to cope with a changing climate and induced coral disturbances, even in reefs that are relatively healthy today. Managing parrotfish is not a panacea for protecting coral reefs but can play a role in sustaining the health of reefs and high-quality habitat for reef fisheries.},

A paucity of fishery data leads to uncertainty about stock status, which may compromise and threaten the economic and food security of the users dependent upon that stock and increase the chances of overfishing. Recent developments in the technology available to collect, manage and analyse fishery-relevant data provide a suite of possible solutions to update and modernize fisheries data systems and greatly expand data collection and analysis. Yet, despite the proliferation of relevant consumer technology, integration of technologically advanced data systems into fisheries management remains the exception rather than the rule. In this study, we describe the current status, challenges and future directions of high-tech data systems in fisheries management in order to understand what has limited their adoption. By reviewing the application of fishery-dependent data technology in multiple fisheries sectors globally, we show that innovation is stagnating as a result of lack of trust and cooperation between fishers and managers. We propose a solution based on a transdisciplinary approach to fishery management that emphasizes the need for collaborative problem-solving among stakeholders. In our proposed system, data feedbacks are a key component to effective fishery data systems, ensuring that fishers and managers collect, have access to and benefit from fisheries data as they work towards a mutually agreed-upon goal. A new approach to fisheries data systems will promote innovation to increase data coverage, accuracy and resolution, while reducing costs and allowing adaptive, responsive, near real-time management decision-making to improve fisheries outcomes.},

At this stage, regulations and subsidies tend to encourage excessive entry and investments, creating the potential for serial depletion. In mature fisheries, regulations often restrict season length, vessel and gear types, fishing areas, and fleet size, causing or exacerbating the race for fish and excessive investment, and are typically unsuccessful except when combined with dedicated access privileges (e.g., territorial rights, individual quotas).

  abstract = {Published papers were reviewed to assess ecosystem impacts of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) and other dedicated access systems. Under ITQs, quota shares increase with higher abundance levels, thus fishers may request lower total allowable catches (TACs) and pay for monitoring and research that improves fishery sustainability. Mortality on target species generally declines because catches are closer to TACs and because ghost fishing through lost and abandoned gear decreases. High-grading and discarding often decline, but may increase if landings (and not catches) count against ITQs and when there is little at-sea enforcement. Overall, ITQs positively impact target species, although collapses can occur if TACs are set too high or if catches are routinely allowed to exceed TACs. Fishing pressure may increase on non-ITQ species because of spillover from ITQ fisheries, and in cases where fishers anticipate that future ITQ allocations will be based on catch history and therefore increase their current catches. Ecosystem and habitat impacts of ITQs were only sparsely covered in the literature and were difficult to assess: ITQs often lead to changes in total fishing effort (both positive and negative), spatial shifts in effort, and fishing gear modifications. Stock assessments may be complicated by changes in the relationship between catch per unit effort, and abundance, but ITQ participants will often assist in improving data collection and stock assessments. Overall, ITQs have largely positive effects on target species, but mixed or unknown effects on non-target fisheries and the overall ecosystem. Favourable outcomes were linked to sustainable TACs and effective enforcement.},

For this formulation, predicted catch composition depends on fishing mortality, and at high fishing mortality levels the entire population can be caught provided the selectivity is nonzero for all age groups. In contrast, the discrete formulation assumes that fishing mortality occurs separately from natural mortality and that fish encounter at most only one set of fishing gear.

  abstract = {Biodiversity indicators provide a vital window on the state of the planet, guiding policy development and management. The most widely adopted marine indicator is mean trophic level (MTL) from catches, intended to detect shifts from high-trophic-level predators to low-trophic-level invertebrates and plankton-feeders. This indicator underpins reported trends in human impacts, declining when predators collapse (``fishing down marine food webs'') and when low-trophic-level fisheries expand (``fishing through marine food webs''). The assumption is that catch MTL measures changes in ecosystem MTL and biodiversity. Here we combine model predictions with global assessments of MTL from catches, trawl surveys and fisheries stock assessments and find that catch MTL does not reliably predict changes in marine ecosystems. Instead, catch MTL trends often diverge from ecosystem MTL trends obtained from surveys and assessments. In contrast to previous findings of rapid declines in catch MTL, we observe recent increases in catch, survey and assessment MTL. However, catches from most trophic levels are rising, which can intensify fishery collapses even when MTL trends are stable or increasing. To detect fishing impacts on marine biodiversity, we recommend greater efforts to measure true abundance trends for marine species, especially those most vulnerable to fishing.},

This paper sparked much controversy through its projection, highlighted in the press release, that all marine fisheries would be collapsed by 2048. Analysis of 664 citing papers revealed that only a small percentage (11\%) referred to the 2048 projection, while 39\% referred to fisheries collapse in general, and 40\% to biodiversity and ecosystem services. The 2048 projection was mentioned more often in papers published soon after the original paper, in low-impact journals, and in journals outside of fields that would be expected to focus on biodiversity. Citing papers also mentioned the 2048 projection more often if they had few authors (28\% of single-author papers vs. 2\% of papers with 10 or more authors). These factors suggest that the more knowledgeable the authors of citing papers were about the controversy over the 2048 projection, the less likely they were to refer to it. A noteworthy finding was that if the original authors were also involved in the citing papers, they rarely (1 of 55 papers, 2\%) mentioned the 2048 projection. Thus the original authors have emphasized the broader concerns about biodiversity loss, rather than the 2048 projection, as the key result of their study.},

Publishing in Science, Nature or Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA is associated with a 34-fold increase in the probability of an article being highly cited, but many highly cited references were also published in journals with impact factors under eight. Proportional contributions to references, taking into account number of authors, author order and other key factors, revealed Bill Ricker and John Roland Brett as the greatest individual contributors, and the US, Canada and the UK as greatest country contributors, with Canada significantly over-represented. Female representation on the list was historically low before increasing to 21\% in the 1990s, and reflected gender changes in the field of fisheries. When compared to {$>$}2000 control papers published in the same journal and year, highly cited fisheries papers were significantly longer (20.4 vs. 9.8 pages) and had more authors (5.8 vs. 4.3), references (118 vs. 51), tables and total illustrations; these differences were greater when high-profile general journals were excluded, but lower when calculated on a per-page basis. References with more than six authors jumped from 0 to 27\% in 2000, coinciding with a rapid uptake of email among fisheries scientists.

  abstract = {How coral reefs survive as oases of life in low-productivity oceans has puzzled scientists for centuries. The answer may lie in internal nutrient cycling and/or input from the pelagic zone. Integrating meta-analysis, field data, and population modelling, we show that the ocean's smallest vertebrates, cryptobenthic reef fishes, promote internal reef-fish biomass production through exceptional larval supply from the pelagic environment. Specifically, cryptobenthics account for two-thirds of reef-fish larvae in the near-reef pelagic zone, despite limited adult reproductive outputs. This overwhelming abundance of cryptobenthic larvae fuels reef trophodynamics via rapid growth and extreme mortality, producing almost 60\% of consumed reef fish biomass. While cryptobenthics are commonly overlooked, their unique demographic dynamics may make them a cornerstone of ecosystem functioning on modern coral reefs.},

A great advance has been recognizing the direct effects of the varying physical environment on lobster abundance and developing testable hypotheses to explain them. Another advance has been in the use of manipulative field experiments to test hypotheses about juvenile population biology, and our understanding of juvenile ecology has also increased greatly. Many new relations among abundance, growth, survival, maturity, and fecundity have also been documented for older lobsters. For some species, biologists have identified the major influences determining abundance, but no obvious generalizations apply across all species. Stock assessments for lobsters must deal with the great complexity that is now documented for particular lobster populations. Yield-per-recruit and egg-per-recruit approaches are now heavily used, but probably do not address the necessary range of real population responses. Stock-production approaches continue to be used where appropriate data are available; great care is required. The role of stock assessment is shifting from identifying over-fishing toward predictive analysis of a range of management actions for each situation.},

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDOxygen concentrations in both the open ocean and coastal waters have been declining since at least the middle of the 20th century. This oxygen loss, or deoxygenation, is one of the most important changes occurring in an ocean increasingly modified by human activities that have raised temperatures, CO2 levels, and nutrient inputs and have altered the abundances and distributions of marine species. Oxygen is fundamental to biological and biogeochemical processes in the ocean. Its decline can cause major changes in ocean productivity, biodiversity, and biogeochemical cycles. Analyses of direct measurements at sites around the world indicate that oxygen-minimum zones in the open ocean have expanded by several million square kilometers and that hundreds of coastal sites now have oxygen concentrations low enough to limit the distribution and abundance of animal populations and alter the cycling of important nutrients.
ADVANCESIn the open ocean, global warming, which is primarily caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, is considered the primary cause of ongoing deoxygenation. Numerical models project further oxygen declines during the 21st century, even with ambitious emission reductions. Rising global temperatures decrease oxygen solubility in water, increase the rate of oxygen consumption via respiration, and are predicted to reduce the introduction of oxygen from the atmosphere and surface waters into the ocean interior by increasing stratification and weakening ocean overturning circulation.In estuaries and other coastal systems strongly influenced by their watershed, oxygen declines have been caused by increased loadings of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and organic matter, primarily from agriculture; sewage; and the combustion of fossil fuels. In many regions, further increases in nitrogen discharges to coastal waters are projected as human populations and agricultural production rise. Climate change exacerbates oxygen decline in coastal systems through similar mechanisms as those in the open ocean, as well as by increasing nutrient delivery from watersheds that will experience increased precipitation.Expansion of low-oxygen zones can increase production of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas; reduce eukaryote biodiversity; alter the structure of food webs; and negatively affect food security and livelihoods. Both acidification and increasing temperature are mechanistically linked with the process of deoxygenation and combine with low-oxygen conditions to affect biogeochemical, physiological, and ecological processes. However, an important paradox to consider in predicting large-scale effects of future deoxygenation is that high levels of productivity in nutrient-enriched coastal systems and upwelling areas associated with oxygen-minimum zones also support some of the world's most prolific fisheries.
OUTLOOKMajor advances have been made toward understanding patterns, drivers, and consequences of ocean deoxygenation, but there is a need to improve predictions at large spatial and temporal scales important to ecosystem services provided by the ocean. Improved numerical models of oceanographic processes that control oxygen depletion and the large-scale influence of altered biogeochemical cycles are needed to better predict the magnitude and spatial patterns of deoxygenation in the open ocean, as well as feedbacks to climate. Developing and verifying the next generation of these models will require increased in situ observations and improved mechanistic understanding on a variety of scales. Models useful for managing nutrient loads can simulate oxygen loss in coastal waters with some skill, but their ability to project future oxygen loss is often hampered by insufficient data and climate model projections on drivers at appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Predicting deoxygenation-induced changes in ecosystem services and human welfare requires scaling effects that are measured on individual organisms to populations, food webs, and fisheries stocks; considering combined effects of deoxygenation and other ocean stressors; and placing an increased research emphasis on developing nations. Reducing the impacts of other stressors may provide some protection to species negatively affected by low-oxygen conditions. Ultimately, though, limiting deoxygenation and its negative effects will necessitate a substantial global decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as reductions in nutrient discharges to coastal waters. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/359/6371/eaam7240/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Low and declining oxygen levels in the open ocean and coastal waters affect processes ranging from biogeochemistry to food security.The global map indicates coastal sites where anthropogenic nutrients have exacerbated or caused O2 declines to {$<$}2 mg liter-1 ({$<$}63 {$\mu$}mol liter-1) (red dots), as well as ocean oxygen-minimum zones at 300 m of depth (blue shaded regions).

Oxygen is fundamental to life. Not only is it essential for the survival of individual animals, but it regulates global cycles of major nutrients and carbon. The oxygen content of the open ocean and coastal waters has been declining for at least the past half-century, largely because of human activities that have increased global temperatures and nutrients discharged to coastal waters. These changes have accelerated consumption of oxygen by microbial respiration, reduced solubility of oxygen in water, and reduced the rate of oxygen resupply from the atmosphere to the ocean interior, with a wide range of biological and ecological consequences. Further research is needed to understand and predict long-term, global- and regional-scale oxygen changes and their effects on marine and estuarine fisheries and ecosystems.},

To conserve species, we must conserve their habitat. This concept is well known, but the reality is much more complex than simply conserving a particular area. Habitats are dynamic and vary across both space and time. Such variation can help to facilitate long-term persistence of species by allowing local movement in search of the best conditions. Brennan et al. clearly demonstrate the benefit of the habitat mosaic to Pacific salmon by characterizing how both climate and population productivity vary over time and space in an Alaskan river system.
Science, this issue p. 783
Watersheds are complex mosaics of habitats whose conditions vary across space and time as landscape features filter overriding climate forcing, yet the extent to which the reliability of ecosystem services depends on these dynamics remains unknown. We quantified how shifting habitat mosaics are expressed across a range of spatial scales within a large, free-flowing river, and how they stabilize the production of Pacific salmon that support valuable fisheries. The strontium isotope records of ear stones (otoliths) show that the relative productivity of locations across the river network, as both natal- and juvenile-rearing habitat, varies widely among years and that this variability is expressed across a broad range of spatial scales, ultimately stabilizing the interannual production of fish at the scale of the entire basin.
Mosaics of habitat increase resilience in salmon populations.

The evolution of water markets has been more complicated than those for other resources. In this paper, we first explain these differences by examining water rights and regulatory issues. Second, we place our research in the context of the economics literature on water marketing. Third, we present new, comprehensive data on prices and the extent, nature, and timing of water transfers across 12 western states from 1987-2005. We find that prices are higher for agriculture-to-urban trades versus within-agriculture trades, in part, reflecting the differences in marginal values between the two uses. Prices for urban use are also growing relative to agricultural use. Markets are responding in that the number of agriculture-to-urban transactions is rising, whereas the number of agriculture-to-agriculture transfers is not. Further, there is a shift from using short-term leases to using multi-year leases of water and permanent sales of water rights. This pattern underscores the need to consider the amounts of water obligated over time, rather than examining only annual flows in assessing the quantities of water traded as is the common practice in the literature. Considering water obligated over time, termed committed water, we find significantly more is transferred and the direction of trading is different than if the focus is on annual flows. Finally, the data reveal considerable variation in water trading across the states.},

  abstract = {In 2011 the National Marine Fisheries Service began a systematic collection of performance indicators for U.S. fisheries managed under catch shares. Catch shares are a fishery management tool that dedicate a secure share of quota allowing individual fishermen, fishing cooperatives, fishing communities, or other entities to harvest a fixed amount of fish. Catch share design varies widely across different programs and regions. Many programs share similar biological, social, and economic management objectives even though these design features are tailored to accommodate particular fishery characteristics. This paper evaluates fisheries using standardized indicators to measure the basic economic performance, regardless of catch share program design. Data collected were used to evaluate the economic and distribution effects of U.S. catch share programs. Catch share fishery performance is compared to a baseline period prior to implementation of the catch share program. Overall, the majority of objectives to improve the economic performance of catch share fisheries were achieved. Catch share programs have been effective in reducing fishing capacity. However, catch share programs have had distributional consequences as there are indications that consolidation is occurring in a number of programs. For example, there have been considerable reductions in the number of active vessels and entities holding quota share in the Alaska Halibut and Sablefish and the Mid-Atlantic Surfclam and Ocean Quahog catch share programs. However, it is important to note that the accumulation of ownership share may be less of a concern than consolidation in the use of quota. Thus, to the extent that consolidation is considered a management problem, it may be more effective to consider caps on the use of quota than by imposing more restrictive ownership caps.},

Coincident with recent exceptional warming of the northwest Atlantic Ocean and removal of large predatory fish, the American lobster has become the most valuable fishery resource in North America. Using a model that links ocean temperature, predator density, and fishing to population productivity, we show that harvester-driven conservation efforts to protect large lobsters prepared the Gulf of Maine lobster fishery to capitalize on favorable ecosystem conditions, resulting in the record-breaking landings recently observed in the region. In contrast, in the warmer southern New England region, the absence of similar conservation efforts precipitated warming-induced recruitment failure that led to the collapse of the fishery. Population projections under expected warming suggest that the American lobster fishery is vulnerable to future temperature increases, but continued efforts to preserve the stock's reproductive potential can dampen the negative impacts of warming. This study demonstrates that, even though global climate change is severely impacting marine ecosystems, widely adopted, proactive conservation measures can increase the resilience of commercial fisheries to climate change.},

Here, we investigate how heterogeneity in catch and profits among fishers influences the trade-off among the triple-bottom-line objectives of recovering a fish population, maximizing its economic value and distributing restrictions equitably across fishers. As a case-study, we examine management reform of an ecologically and economically important coral reef fishery operating within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Using a simulation model, we find that total profitability of the fishing industry is 40\% lower if recovery plans are equitable when compared to the most economically efficient plan. However, efficient recovery plans were typically highly inequitable because they required some fishers to cease fishing. Equity was defined according to different norms, and the efficiency loss was greatest when catch losses were shared equally across fishers rather than in proportion to their historical catch. We then varied key social, economic and biological parameters to identify cases when equity and efficient recovery would trade-off most strongly. Recovery plans could be both efficient and equitable when heterogeneity in fisher's catches and individual catch efficiencies was lower. If fishers were homogenous then equitable plans could have maximal economic efficiency. These results emphasize the importance of considering heterogeneity in individual fishers when designing recovery plans. Recovery plans that are inequitable may often fail to gain stakeholder support, so in fisheries with high heterogeneity we should temper our expectations for marked increases in profits.},

Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

The two most profitable fisheries in the Galapagos Islands, red spiny lobster (Panulirus penicillatus) and sea cucumber (Isostichopus fuscus), are facing steep declines in abundance and may be on the verge of collapse. This state of affairs has emerged in part because of command and control fisheries policies that neglected the importance of the behavior of the fishing fleet itself. Here we attempt to describe and explain the factors influencing the fishing behavior of the Galapagos red spiny lobster fishing fleet. We estimated a set of econometric models based on a random utility maximization process to forecast how changes in the immediate circumstances (economic, biological, climatic and oceanographic) impact voluntary fishing choices via the personal costs and benefits of various decisions. We focused on the factors that affect not only the decision to participate in fishing but also the decision of where to fish. We then use these models to determine the revenue elasticities for each fishing zone and to analyze the overall response of the Galapagos fleet to hypothetical closures of fishing zones. Our results provide some empirical benchmarks from which it is possible to identify in advance problems related to the spatial management of the red spiny lobster fishery and their potential solutions. For example, we found that fisherman from San Cristobal Island have a strong preference for fishing sites on Floreana Island, which is geographically closer to Santa Cruz Island. This could lead to conflicts between the San Cristobal and Santa Cruz fishing fleets if rights-based fishery management were implemented. We expect that our analysis will be valuable to policy makers when designing new types of management plans for Galapagos fisheries.},

The Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR) established a network of coastal NTZs in 2001, yet, to date no study has investigated their effectiveness in protecting and enabling key species to recover. Using data from the Galapagos National Park Directorate annual Lobster Population Monitoring Program from 2012 to 2014, this study evaluated the recovery of the commercially valuable red spiny lobster (Panulirus penicillatus) inside NTZs in the GMR. It was hypothesized that NTZs would present higher lobster abundances or sizes when compared with adjacent fished zones. However, the study found no significant differences in these comparisons. Overall the findings indicate that {$>$} 11 years of protection has had no appreciable effect on lobster abundances or sizes inside the NTZs. This paper explores possible reasons for the lack of response in NTZs, and concluded that non-compliance and shortcomings within the enforcement framework of the GMR are the key factors limiting the functionality of these NTZs. Additionally, it also evaluates the limitations of the current monitoring program and highlights the need for a more comprehensive and long-term program to be implemented. As the new zoning scheme for NTZs in the GMR that began in 2016 is still to be determined, this information should be considered by decision makers to improve the effectiveness of NTZs and sustainable management of the GRM's coastal resources.},

Marine ecosystems have been exploited for a long time, growing increasingly vulnerable to collapse and irreversible change. How do we know when an ecosystem may be in danger? A measure of the status of individual stocks is only a partial gauge of its status, and does not include changes at the broader ecosystem level, to non-commercial species or to its structure or functioning. Six ecosystem indicators measuring trends over time were collated for 19 ecosystems, corresponding to four ecological attributes: resource potential, ecosystem structure and functioning, conservation of functional biodiversity, and ecosystem stability and resistance to perturbations. We explored the use of a decision-tree approach, a definition of initial ecosystem state (impacted or non-impacted), and the trends in the ecosystem indicators to classify the ecosystems into improving, stationary, and deteriorating. Ecosystem experts classified all ecosystems as impacted at the time of their initial state. Of these, 15 were diagnosed as ``ugly'', because they had deteriorated from an already impacted state. Several also exhibited specific combinations of trends indicating ``fishing down the foodweb'', reduction in size structure, reduction in diversity and stability, and changed productivity. The classification provides an initial evaluation for scientists, resource managers, stakeholders, and the general public of the concerning status of ecosystems globally.},

To date, the IndiSeas programme (Indicators for the Seas) has focussed on assessing the ecological impacts of fishing at the ecosystem scale using ecological indicators. Here, we explore fisheries `Management Effectiveness' and `Governance Quality' and relate this to ecosystem health and status. We developed a dedicated expert survey, focused at the ecosystem level, with a series of questions addressing aspects of management and governance, from an ecosystem-based perspective, using objective and evidence-based criteria. The survey was completed by ecosystem experts (managers and scientists) and results analysed using ranking and multivariate methods. Results were further examined for selected ecosystems, using expert knowledge, to explore the overall findings in greater depth. Higher scores for `Management Effectiveness' and `Governance Quality' were significantly and positively related to ecosystems with better ecological status. Key factors that point to success in delivering fisheries and conservation objectives were as follows: the use of reference points for management, frequent review of stock assessments, whether Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) catches were being accounted for and addressed, and the inclusion of stakeholders. Additionally, we found that the implementation of a long-term management plan, including economic and social dimensions of fisheries in exploited ecosystems, was a key factor in successful, sustainable fisheries management. Our results support the thesis that good ecosystem-based management and governance, sustainable fisheries and healthy ecosystems go together.},

The analysis is set in the context of literature about the need to widen participation in the determination of Local Agenda 21 policies, and the drive for more inclusionary forms of communication in planning and politics. Workshop members discussed the results of surveys and in-depth discussion groups with local residents which had revealed considerable scepticism and mistrust of environmental communications and environmental expertise. Three themes are explored. First, there is consensus in attributing responsibility for public alienation and resistance to environmental communications to the content and styles of media reporting. Second, there are contrasting discursive constructions of the 'public', which reflect different political cultures-with the Nottingham workshop supporting a strategy to share power and knowledge more widely than hitherto, whereas the Eindhoven strategy proposed greater rigour, clarity, and authority from the local state. Third, responding to evidence of public resistance to calls for more sustainable practices, workshop participants in both cities focused on what institutions themselves can and should do to progress environmental goals. Workshop participants in both countries acknowledged the urgent need for public, private, and voluntary sector organisations to match their own practices to their environmental rhetoric.},

Many of the species most threatened by fishing are caught in multispecies fisheries, which can remain profitable even as populations of some species collapse. Here we show for multispecies fisheries that the biological and socioeconomic conditions that would eventually cause species to be severely depleted or even driven extinct can be identified decades before those species experience high harvest rates or marked population declines. Because fishing effort imposes a common source of mortality on all species in a fishery, the long-term impact of a fishery on a species is predicted by measuring its loss rate relative to that of species that influence the fishery's maximal effort. We tested our approach on eight Pacific tuna and billfish populations, four of which have been identified recently as in decline and threatened with overfishing. The severe depletion of all four populations could have been predicted in the 1950s, using our approach. Our results demonstrate that species threatened by human harvesting can be identified much earlier, providing time for adjustments in harvesting practices before consequences become severe and fishery closures or other socioeconomically disruptive interventions are required to protect species.},

  abstract = {Demographic connectivity is a fundamental process influencing the dynamics and persistence of spatially structured populations. Consequently, quantifying connectivity is essential for properly designing networks of protected areas so that they achieve their core ecological objective of maintaining population persistence. Recently, many empirical studies in marine systems have provided essential, and historically challenging to obtain, data on patterns of larval dispersal and export from marine protected areas (MPAs). Here, we review the empirical studies that have directly quantified the origins and destinations of individual larvae and assess those studies' relevance to the theory of population persistence and MPA design objectives. We found that empirical studies often do not measure or present quantities that are relevant to assessing population persistence, even though most studies were motivated or contextualized by MPA applications. Persistence of spatial populations, like nonspatial populations, depends on replacement, whether individuals reproduce enough in their lifetime to replace themselves. In spatial populations, one needs to account for the effect of larval dispersal on future recruitment back to the local population through local retention and other connectivity pathways. The most commonly reported descriptor of larval dispersal was the fraction of recruitment from local origin (self-recruitment). Self-recruitment does not inform persistence-based MPA design because it is a fraction of those arriving, not a fraction of those leaving (local retention), so contains no information on replacement. Some studies presented connectivity matrices, which can inform assessments of persistence with additional knowledge of survival and fecundity after recruitment. Some studies collected data in addition to larval dispersal that could inform assessments of population persistence but which were not presented in that way. We describe how three pieces of empirical information are needed to fully describe population persistence in a network of MPAs: (1) lifetime fecundity, (2) the proportion of larvae that are locally retained (or the full connectivity matrix), and (3) survival rate after recruitment. We conclude by linking theory and data to provide detailed guidance to empiricists and practitioners on field sampling design and data presentation that better informs the MPA objective of population persistence.},

  abstract = {Balanced harvesting \textendash{} harvesting all species and sizes in an ecosystem in proportion to their productivity \textendash{} is a fisheries management strategy that has been suggested recently to increase yields, while reducing overall ecosystem impact. However, some aspects of balanced harvesting are controversial, including its call for extensive harvesting of juveniles and forage fish. Balanced harvesting also calls for targeting species and size-classes that are not currently marketable, possibly at a significant economic cost. Some have argued that this cost is outweighed by the ecological benefits of maintaining the ecosystem size and trophic structures and by the benefits of extra yield for food security. There is broad consensus that balanced harvesting would require major changes to fishery management institutions and consumer behaviour, and it is unclear to what extent it is physically possible with current technologies. For this reason, we argue that steps to implement balanced harvesting are difficult to justify until the case for it is more clearly resolved. We outline some of the pivotal questions that must be answered to make a convincing case for or against balanced harvesting, many of which can be answered empirically. In identifying these questions, we hope to offer a constructive path forward in resolving some of the key issues in the balanced harvesting debate.},

  abstract = {Economic incentives to harvest a species usually diminish as its abundance declines, because harvest costs increase. This prevents harvesting to extinction. A known exception can occur if consumer demand causes a declining species' harvest price to rise faster than costs. This threat may affect rare and valuable species, such as large land mammals, sturgeons, and bluefin tunas. We analyze a similar but underappreciated threat, which arises when the geographic area (range) occupied by a species contracts as its abundance declines. Range contractions maintain the local densities of declining populations, which facilitates harvesting to extinction by preventing abundance declines from causing harvest costs to rise. Factors causing such range contractions include schooling, herding, or flocking behaviors\textemdash{}which, ironically, can be predator-avoidance adaptations; patchy environments; habitat loss; and climate change. We use a simple model to identify combinations of range contractions and price increases capable of causing extinction from profitable overharvesting, and we compare these to an empirical review. We find that some aquatic species that school or forage in patchy environments experience sufficiently severe range contractions as they decline to allow profitable harvesting to extinction even with little or no price increase; and some high-value declining aquatic species experience severe price increases. For terrestrial species, the data needed to evaluate our theory are scarce, but available evidence suggests that extinction-enabling range contractions may be common among declining mammals and birds. Thus, factors causing range contraction as abundance declines may pose unexpectedly large extinction risks to harvested species.},

  abstract = {Healthy fisheries can reduce bycatch
Bycatch of marine mammals, turtles, and birds during commercial fishing is a considerable threat. Activities intended to reduce bycatch are often thought to conflict with commercial fishing. However, Burgess et al. show that in the majority of cases, managing fishery stocks to best promote long-term sustainability would also reduce bycatch. Rebuilding fish stocks will naturally promote lower bycatch, and these factors together will facilitate sustainable profit generation from fish harvest.
Science, this issue p. 1255
Reductions in global fishing pressure are needed to end overfishing of target species and maximize the value of fisheries. We ask whether such reductions would also be sufficient to protect non\textendash{}target species threatened as bycatch. We compare changes in fishing pressure needed to maximize profits from 4713 target fish stocks\textemdash{}accounting for {$>$}75\% of global catch\textemdash{}to changes in fishing pressure needed to reverse ongoing declines of 20 marine mammal, sea turtle, and seabird populations threatened as bycatch. We project that maximizing fishery profits would halt or reverse declines of approximately half of these threatened populations. Recovering the other populations would require substantially greater effort reductions or targeting improvements. Improving commercial fishery management could thus yield important collateral benefits for threatened bycatch species globally.
Rebuilding fishery stocks will also promote recovery of threatened marine mammals, turtles, and birds.

Advances in computation have made it possible to construct agent-based models (ABMs)\textemdash{}which explicitly describe the behaviour of individual people, firms, or vessels in order to understand and predict their aggregate behaviours. ABMs are widely used for both academic and applied purposes in many settings including finance, urban planning, and the military, but are not yet mainstream in fisheries science and management, despite a growing literature. ABMs are well suited to understanding emergent consequences of fisher interactions, heterogeneity, and bounded rationality, especially in complex ecological, social, and institutional contexts. For these reasons, we argue that ABMs of human behaviour can contribute significantly to human dimensions of fisheries in three areas: 1) understanding interactions between multiple management institutions; 2) incorporating cognitive and behavioural sciences into fisheries science and practice; and 3) understanding and projecting the social consequences of management institutions. We provide simple examples illustrating the potential for ABMs in each of these areas, using conceptual (`toy') versions of the POSEIDON model. We argue that salient strategic advances in these areas could pave the way for increased tactical use of ABMs in fishery management settings. We review common ABM development and application challenges, with the aim of providing guidance to beginning ABM developers and users studying human dimensions of fisheries.},

  abstract = {Many anthropogenic stressors broadly inflict mortality or reduce fecundity, including habitat destruction, pollution, climate change, invasive species, and multispecies harvesting. Here, we show\textemdash{}in four analytical models of interspecies competition\textemdash{}that broadly inflicted stressors disproportionately cause competitive exclusions within groups of ecologically similar species. As a result, we predict that ecosystems become progressively thinner\textemdash{}that is, they have progressively less functional redundancy\textemdash{}as broadly inflicted stressors become progressively more intense. This may negatively affect the temporal stability of ecosystem functions, but it also buffers ecosystem productivity against stress by favoring species less sensitive to the stressors. Our main result follows from the weak limiting similarity principle: species with more similar ecological niches compete more strongly, and their coexistence can be upset by smaller perturbations. We show that stressors can cause indirect competitive exclusions at much lower stressor intensity than needed to directly cause species extinction, consistent with the finding of empirical studies that species interactions are often the proximal drivers of local extinctions. The excluded species are more sensitive to the stressor relative to their ecologically similar competitors. Moreover, broadly inflicted stressors may cause hydra effects\textemdash{}where higher stressor intensity results in higher abundance for a species with lower sensitivity to the stressor than its competitors. Correlations between stressor impacts and ecological niches reduce the potential for indirect competitive exclusions, but they consequently also reduce the buffering effect of ecosystem thinning on ecosystem productivity. Our findings suggest that ecosystems experiencing stress may continue to provision ecosystem services but lose functional redundancy and stability.},

Both measures are higher in the ocean than on land at some latitudes, despite slower ocean warming. These indices give a complex mosaic of predicted range shifts and phenology changes that deviate from simple poleward migration and earlier springs or later falls. They also emphasize potential conservation concerns, because areas of high marine biodiversity often have greater velocities of climate change and seasonal shifts.},

Here we use the velocity of climate change to derive spatial trajectories for climatic niches from 1960 to 2009 (ref. 7) and from 2006 to 2100, and use the properties of these trajectories to infer changes in species distributions. Coastlines act as barriers and locally cooler areas act as attractors for trajectories, creating source and sink areas for local climatic conditions. Climate source areas indicate where locally novel conditions are not connected to areas where similar climates previously occurred, and are thereby inaccessible to climate migrants tracking isotherms: 16\% of global surface area for 1960 to 2009, and 34\% of ocean for the /`business as usual/' climate scenario (representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5) representing continued use of fossil fuels without mitigation. Climate sink areas are where climate conditions locally disappear, potentially blocking the movement of climate migrants. Sink areas comprise 1.0\% of ocean area and 3.6\% of land and are prevalent on coasts and high ground. Using this approach to infer shifts in species distributions gives global and regional maps of the expected direction and rate of shifts of climate migrants, and suggests areas of potential loss of species richness.},

  abstract = {Coastal habitats that serve as nursery grounds for numerous marine species are badly degraded, yet the traditional means of modeling populations of exploited marine species handle spatiotemporal changes in habitat characteristics and life history dynamics poorly, if at all. To explore how nursery habitat degradation impacts recruitment of a mobile, benthic species, we developed a spatially explicit, individual-based model that describes the recruitment of Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) in the Florida Keys, where a cascade of environmental disturbances has reconfigured nursery habitat structure. In recent years, the region has experienced a series of linked perturbations, among them, seagrass die-offs, cyanobacteria blooms, and the mass mortality of sponges. Sponges are important shelters for juvenile spiny lobster, an abundant benthic predator that also sustains Florida's most valuable fishery. In the model, we simulated monthly settlement of individual lobster postlarvae and the daily growth, mortality, shelter selection, and movement of individual juvenile lobsters on a spatially explicit grid of habitat cells configured to represent the Florida Keys coastal nursery. Based on field habitat surveys, cells were designated as either seagrass or hard-bottom, and hard-bottom cells were further characterized in terms of their shelter- and size-specific lobster carrying capacities. The effect of algal blooms on sponge mortality, hence lobster habitat structure, was modeled based on the duration of exposure of each habitat cell to the blooms. Ten-year simulations of lobster recruitment with and without algal blooms suggest that the lobster population should be surprisingly resilient to massive disturbances of this type. Data not used in model development showed that predictions of large changes in lobster shelter utilization, yet small effects on recruitment in response to blooms, were realistic. The potentially severe impacts of habitat loss on recruitment were averted by compensatory changes in habitat utilization and mobility by larger individuals, coupled with periods of fortuitously high larval settlement. Our model provides an underutilized approach for assessing habitat effects on open populations with complex life histories, and our results illustrate the potential pitfalls of relying on intuition to infer the effects of habitat perturbations on upper trophic levels.},

To do so requires the integration of spatio-temporal change in environmental quality and its subsequent effects on habitat suitability and life history dynamics. Spatially-explicit, individual-based simulation models are particularly well suited to this task and, although they are seeing increased use in fisheries ecology and management, this approach has seen limited application in crustacean fisheries. In 1993, we began development of a spatially-explicit individual-based model (IBM) describing the recruitment of Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) in the Florida Keys, Florida (USA) to investigate the impact of regional changes in environmental quality, habitat structure and postlarval supply on lobster recruitment. The shallow coastal waters of the Florida Keys ecosystem have experienced an unprecedented series of environmental perturbations over the past decade. Seagrass die-offs, cyanobacteria blooms, sponge die-offs and dramatic changes in salinity have occurred and these potentially impact the recruitment of spiny lobsters in the region via both direct and indirect means. Here I provide an overview of the unique approach that we have used to examine these dynamics, an approach that links environmental events that occur on large scales (e.g. changes in habitat structure and salinity) with their population-level consequences for lobsters via impacts that operate on the individual-level. Although not applicable in all situations, spatially-explicit IBMs should see wider use in crustacean fishery applications because of both the ecological insight they yield and their ability to integrate data across hierarchical scales of organization.},

Further implementation issues discussed are: candidate procedure selection in principle and practice, the extent of robustness testing desirable, the link to the evaluation of research priorities, and the reception accorded the management procedure approach by industry and decision-makers.

But when the appropriate governance systems are not functionally in place, the unwanted effects of privatization can have deleterious consequences. This paper highlights the consequences of undesirable privatization and the emergent unwanted privatization tendencies of the coastal commons, particularly in the developing countries such as the Philippines. The lack of coherent policies, standards, and weak enforcement of policies in leasing the coastal commons (e.g. various unregulated aquaculture) in the Philippines in particular, have resulted to alarming displacement, deprivation and marginalization of fishing and farming communities and have degraded many coastal zone areas. In addition, poorly planned coastal tourism and housing development projects in the foreshore areas, inappropriate reclamation of coastal areas, illegal usurpation of indigenous people's rights over ancestral domain areas, and conversion of fishing and fish farming zones into ecotourism zones further aggravated this scenario. Equitable access to resources is of paramount importance to afford concerned stakeholders greater participation in terms of developing greater capacity for coastal communities to engage and demand for improved coastal governance \textendash{} an important facet of public administration often identified as one of the challenges in managing the commons. Co-management with an Ecosystem-Based Management approach as core operational mechanism provides opportunities to enhance policy formulation and implementation, secure community safety nets, and facilitate the creation of a level-playing environment that help to prevent the unwanted effects of privatization.},

  abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) is increasingly utilized to sustainably manage ocean uses. Marine protected areas (MPAs), a form of spatial management in which parts of the ocean are regulated to fishing, are now a common tool in MSP for conserving marine biodiversity and managing fisheries. However, the use of MPAs in MSP often neglects \textendash{} or simplifies \textendash{} the redistribution of fishing and non-fishing activities inside and outside of MPAs following their implementation. This redistribution of effort can have important implications for effective MSP. Using long term (14 years) aerial surveys of boats at the California Channel Islands, we examined the spatial redistribution of fishing and non-fishing activities and their drivers following MPA establishment. Our data represent 6 years of information before the implementation of an MPA network and 8 years after implementation. Different types of boats responded in different ways to the closures, ranging from behaviors by commercial dive boats that support the hypothesis of fishing-the-line, to behaviors by urchin, sport fishing, and recreational boats that support the theory of ideal free distribution. Additionally, we found that boats engaged in recreational activities targeted areas that are sheltered from large waves and located near their home ports, while boats engaged in fishing activities also avoided high wave areas but were not constrained by the distance to their home ports. We did not observe the expected pattern of effort concentration near MPA borders for some boat types; this can be explained by the habitat preference of certain activities (for some activities, the desired habitat attributes are not inside the MPAs), species' biology (species such as urchins where the MPA benefit would likely come from larval export rather than adult spillover), or policy-infraction avoidance. The diversity of boat responses reveals variance from the usual simplified assumption that all extractive boats respond similarly to MPA establishment. Our work is the first empirical study to analyze the response of both commercial and recreational boats to closure. Our results will inform MSP in better accounting for effort redistribution by ocean users in response to the implementation of MPAs and other closures. This article is protected by copyright.

  abstract = {Food security remains a principal challenge in the developing tropics where communities rely heavily on marine-based protein. While some improvements in fisheries management have been made in these regions, a large fraction of coastal fisheries remain unmanaged, mismanaged, or use only crude input controls. These quasi-open-access conditions often lead to severe overfishing, depleted stocks, and compromised food security. A possible fishery management approach in these institution-poor settings is to implement fully protected~marine protected areas (MPAs). Although the primary push for MPAs has been to solve the conservation problems that arise from mismanagement, MPAs can also benefit fisheries beyond their borders. The literature has not completely characterized how to design MPAs under diverse ecological and economic conditions when food security is the objective. We integrated four key biological and economic variables (i.e., fish population growth rate, fish mobility, fish price, and fishing cost) as well as an important aspect of reserve design (MPA size) into a general model and determined their combined influence on food security when MPAs are implemented in an open-access setting. We explicitly modeled open-access conditions that account for the behavioral response of fishers to the MPA; this approach is distinct from much of the literature that focuses on assumptions of ``scorched earth'' (i.e., severe over-fishing), optimized management, or an arbitrarily defined fishing mortality outside the MPA's boundaries. We found that the MPA size that optimizes catch depends strongly on economic variables. Large MPAs optimize catch for species heavily harvested for their high value and/or low harvesting cost, while small MPAs or no closure are best for species lightly harvested for their low value and high harvesting cost. Contrary to previous theoretical expectations, both high and low mobility species are expected to experience conservation benefits from protection, although, as shown previously, greater conservation benefits are expected for low mobility species. Food security benefits from MPAs can be obtained from species of any mobility. Results deliver both qualitative insights and quantitative~guidance for designing MPAs for food security in open-access fisheries.},

  abstract = {The last decade has seen growing concern at the uncertain effectiveness of most fisheries assessment and management approaches as reflected by trends in global landing statistics published by FAO. These imply full exploitation of the majority of fishery resources and a serious overcapitalization of fleets at the global level. Projected increases in demand, future prices for fisheries products, and impacts of growing world populations on the ecosystem all require an urgent search for improved management frameworks. Improved management of fisheries requires, first, an understanding of the axioms and working assumptions underlying the current approaches and how these evolved in response to regional or local conditions and target species. This should promote integration of methodologies which better reflect local situations and can be expressed in the form of one or more working paradigms. These paradigms should incorporate ecosystem considerations, including environmental fluctuations and socio-economic factors. They should not assume that current production levels are independent of natural fluctuations and human impacts and should recognize the dangers of maintaining open access to marine resources throughout their seasonal cycle, life history and distribution range. `Wide-use' management paradigms incorporating explicit user rights, participatory management and inputs from a variety of disciplines and stakeholders are becoming popular, but must operate within a hierarchy of pre-negotiated responses to pre-specified limit reference points so that social and economic options are not lost because conservation issues have not been given precedence. Academic and research institutions could aid the management process by more participation, by promoting interdisciplinary teamwork with stakeholders and by breaking down excessive specialization and regionalization within fisheries studies. On the management side, the key elements for improving the situation seem to be consultative management frameworks that explicitly incorporate `watchdog' functions and implement `precautionary' approaches to management. Risk-averse strategies are appropriate but, given the high level of uncertainty that managers face with natural systems, `fail-safe' management with redundancy, both in the data sources they rely on for fishery performance and in the management measures applied, seem appropriate. For near-shore resources, governments could consider partly devolving management responsibility to appropriate levels in society, involving coastal communities, individual use rights and other vehicles for allocating access. Changing emphasis of modern technology from fisheries exploitation to improved management will be one aspect of successful future management systems, perhaps incorporating geotemporally defined access rights to near-shore and shelf resources. Recent international agreements, including the formal ratification of the Law of the Sea, show that governments are prepared for more ecologically appropriate approaches. The key stake of the fisheries industry in sustainable fisheries development needs supporting, particularly for developing countries, now the major source of aquatic marine products. High priorities for management of marine resources are rebuilding depleted resources and restoring habitats, with concern for maintaining genetic and ecological diversity. There will be a need to consider impacts of global trade on conservation of resources for future generations, if proper management is to be maintained in the face of growing demand. International agreements of relevance to future management paradigms which are compatible with the Law of the Sea Convention (and each other), include Agenda 21 of UNCED, the Biodiversity Convention, the UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, the Compliance Agreement and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Such agreements, ratified or now open for signature, provide a comprehensive basis for future `customary law' that can assist authorities in constructing appropriate management frameworks. Current concern remains with application of these agreements in international waters, where limited access as required for proper management still has not been established.},

Indicators related to recruitment success in the fishery between 1968 and 2003 were followed and comparisons with life history stages (in trawl surveys conducted over 15 years) allowed the temporal sequence of events in the life cycle to be established. Although recruitment seems to be synchronized with bottom temperature, and may be related to abundance changes in groundfish predators, the main factors determining recruitment fluctuations appear to be density-dependent interactions between life history stages. Establishing the abundance and timing of successive life history stages using the traffic light approach seems to provide a reliable indication of their passage through the fishery, and might be used to make forecasts of the condition of the fishery several years ahead. The analysis raises the question of which of a number of possible density-dependent factors are dominant. Two management approaches by reference points and fisheries control rules are suggested.},

This paper presents and applies a forest accounting methodology that overcomes these limitations and allows for homogeneous aggregation of commercial and environmental values (using exchange values, and not welfare measurements, for the latter). We have applied the accounting system proposed here to two major types of multiple-use forest of the Iberian peninsula: Mediterranean forest (Monfrag{\"u}e cork oak dehesa) and conifer forest (Scottish pine in the Guadarrama mountain range). Our results show that non-commercial incomes are relatively more important in the pine forest under consideration, both in private and in social terms. Cork oak forest is notably more profitable in private terms than pine forest, however. Conventional national accounting measures only 24\% and 77\% of social total income in Guadarrama Scottish forest and Monfrag{\"u}e cork oak dehesa, respectively.},

We applied the separability assumption to model recruitment process error as additive effects of random annual deviates and quarterly fixed effects (QFEM) to improve our understanding of intra-annual recruitment patterns and, at the same time, minimize the impact of over-parameterization. We formulated a length-based model with a quarter-year temporal resolution and applied it to the anchovy (Engraulis ringens) fishery off northern Chile and southern Peru, using data from 1984 to 2015. Model performance was compared to that of a larger model in which the process error is treated as an interaction of quarter-year effects (QYIM). QFEM proved to be most adequate only when the variability of population processes and the fishery are determined by a clear seasonal pattern. In those cases, QFEM characterized recruitment seasonality as well as inter-annual trends. Under these conditions, the separability hypothesis of recruitment process error substantially reduced the number of parameters in the stock assessment model, the bias of estimated population variables, and uncertainty when the most recent data were incomplete or non-informative. QFEM provides an alternative way to improve assessments and fishery management for fast-growing and short-lived species such as small pelagic fish.},

Performance did not vary between artisanal and industrial FIPs or according to the economic development status of the country. The probability of achieving improvements in management and overfishing domains is higher for fisheries with FIPs compared to those without.

In this study, we analyzed data obtained from 147 instrumented pelagic longline sets equipped with hook timers and temperature depth recorders to characterize the distribution of hooking contacts and success at a fine temporal and spatial scale. Scientific surveys were carried out in the Central\textendash{}South Pacific Ocean (French Polynesia), targeting tropical (Thunnus albacares, Thunnus obesus) and temperate (Thunnus alalunga) tuna.

This review updates the relationships between different life history stages that have provided some important insights for the stock assessment and management of this fishery. The study highlights the management uses of the catch prediction relationship, up to 4 years ahead, of the commercial rock lobster fishery as well as that of the licensed recreational fishery based on the level of puerulus settlement. The relationships between catch and puerulus settlement indicate that the density-dependent relative survival at different levels of puerulus settlement can vary by a factor of 5. Oceanographic modelling of the 9\textendash{}11-month larval phase of the lobster suggests that ocean currents completely mix the larvae from all spawning regions, while tagging of juveniles and adults confirms that the stock forms a metapopulation consisting of subpopulations of juveniles and adults that generally undergo migrations of less than 50 km. This emphasises the importance of examining the spawning stock over the whole fishery when assessing the stock\textendash{}recruitment relationship. The south-flowing Leeuwin Current significantly influences the level and spatial distribution of the puerulus settlement along the coast.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium production models were used to provide guidance/information on the exploitation level of the main deep-water crustacean fishery in the western Mediterranean. Annual catch and effort (engine horsepower) data from 1957 to 2001 were used to compute a long data series of catch per unit effort (CPUE) as kg/HP. Furthermore, a sampling program on-board the trawl fleet in the Balearic Islands was carried out between 1991 and 2001 to estimate the annual CPUE in kg/h. Both CPUE data series were used to fit non-equilibrium production models. Process-error estimators were applied to the Fox model and observation-error estimators to the Schaefer model. Parameter estimates obtained from the short CPUE data series were unreliable and highly uncertain for both models, mainly due to insufficient contrast in the data between 1991 and 2001. The parameter triplet k, r, and q (i.e. the carrying capacity, intrinsic rate of biomass increase and catchability coefficient), as estimated with the CPUE (kg/HP) data series from 1957 to 2001, gave 1814 t, 0.327 per year and 0.054 for the Fox model and 3656 t, 0.226 per year and 0.019 for the Schaefer model. These results were used to calculate biological reference points. Maximum sustainable yield, YMSY, was estimated at 218 t (Fox) and 210 t (Schaefer). Parameter estimates were less variable for the Schaefer model and these were therefore used for management recommendations. Currently, catches are 30\% below the YMSY, suggesting that red shrimp (RS) is slightly under-exploited. A precautionary fishing effort was estimated taking into account the uncertainty of the parameters. Consequently, a fishing effort corresponding to a biomass level of 60\% of the carrying capacity, f60\%k, was adopted. At the current fishing effort, catches in 2002 remain at recent levels. Nevertheless, taking into account the precautionary approach in the fisheries, it is recommended that catches in 2003 should not exceed approximately 100 t, so that the long-term catch would correspond to f60\%k, which is estimated to be around 200 t.

Despite the simplifying assumptions of production models, the correct use of these models can provide an insight into species/fishery dynamics and can be used to analyse the effect of changes in the level of fishing level on catches. It should be noted, however, that the perception of the exploitation level of RS presented in this study should be further validated. It is recommended that the sampling program to collect data on fishing effort (fishing hours) should be continued allowing the non-equilibrium production models, both with frequencist and Bayesian approaches, to be applied to a longer CPUE (kg/h) data series.},

  abstract = {Human exploitation of marine resources is profoundly altering marine ecosystems, while climate change is expected to further impact commercially-harvested fish and other species. Although the global fishery is a highly complex system with many unpredictable aspects, the bioenergetic limits on fish production and the response of fishing effort to profit are both relatively tractable, and are sure to play important roles. Here we describe a generalized, coupled biological-economic model of the global marine fishery that represents both of these aspects in a unified framework, the BiOeconomic mArine Trophic Size-spectrum (BOATS) model. BOATS predicts fish production according to size spectra as a function of net primary production and temperature, and dynamically determines harvest spectra from the biomass density and interactive, prognostic fishing effort. Within this framework, the equilibrium fish biomass is determined by the economic forcings of catchability, ex-vessel price and cost per unit effort, while the peak harvest depends on the ecosystem parameters. Comparison of a large ensemble of idealized simulations with observational databases, focusing on historical biomass and peak harvests, allows us to narrow the range of several uncertain ecosystem parameters, rule out most parameter combinations, and select an optimal ensemble of model variants. Compared to the prior distributions, model variants with lower values of the mortality rate, trophic efficiency, and allometric constant agree better with observations. For most acceptable parameter combinations, natural mortality rates are more strongly affected by temperature than growth rates, suggesting different sensitivities of these processes to climate change. These results highlight the utility of adopting large-scale, aggregated data constraints to reduce model parameter uncertainties and to better predict the response of fisheries to human behaviour and climate change.},

How well this terrestrial-based theory can be applied toward the design and application of reserves in the coastal marine environment depends, in part, on the degree of similarity between these systems. Several marked differences in ecological and evolutionary processes exist between marine and terrestrial ecosystems as ramifications of fundamental differences in their physical environments (i.e., the relative prevalence of air and water) and contemporary patterns of human impacts. Most notably, the great extent and rate of dispersal of nutrients, materials, holoplanktonic organisms, and reproductive propagules of benthic organisms expand scales of connectivity among nearshore communities and ecosystems. Consequently, the ``openness'' of marine populations, communities, and ecosystems probably has marked influences on their spatial, genetic, and trophic structures and dynamics in ways experienced by only some terrestrial species. Such differences appear to be particularly significant for the kinds of organisms most exploited and targeted for protection in coastal marine ecosystems (fishes and macroinvertebrates). These and other differences imply some unique design criteria and application of reserves in the marine environment. In explaining the implications of these differences for marine reserve design and application, we identify many of the environmental and ecological processes and design criteria necessary for consideration in the development of the analytical approaches developed elsewhere in this Special Issue.},

This research investigates consumers' factors underlying food choice and their attitudes toward healthy eating. The participants completed a questionnaire composed by two parts. The first one was based on the Food Choice Questionnaire where the mean scores and factor analyses pointed to ``sensory appeal,''``price'' and ``convenience'' as the most important factors in Spaniards' food choice. The agglomerative hierarchical clustering grouped women and adult people as the most concerned population about health and weight control. Considering the latter factor, the items ``is low in calories,''``help me to control my weight'' were more associated with ``is low in fat'' than ``Is low in sugar.'' The second part of the questionnaire asked about the consumption frequencies of different kind of foods and revealed dairy products as the most consumed ones. Furthermore, foods with specific health-promoting ingredients exhibited low consumption frequency, most likely motivated by the low interest or knowledge about their health benefits.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
Knowing the main factors underlying consumers' food choice provides important information for having a better understanding of consumers' interest and attitudes toward healthy eating, as well as their concerns about factors involving purchase decision. Knowledge about perceptions toward healthy foods is useful for researchers, producer, manufacturers and health professionals as a first step to design public health policies and consumer education strategies. In addition, the methodology used in the present study with potential application to any kind of population, establishes relationships between consumers perception and food consumption behavior for Spanish consumers.},

The results presented here are largely based on the findings of two surveys. In September 1993, we conducted in-depth interviews with most of the major halibut processors in British Columbia. These processors reported significant changes in the processing and marketing of halibut. In Spring 1994, we conducted a mail survey of all 435 licensed halibut fishermen. The survey consisted of several series of questions designed to measure changes in fishing operations (crew size, fishing practices, etc.), quota leasing activities, changes in fishing income, and opinions about the effects of IVQs.

  abstract = {The ecological role played by man as a top predator in a rocky intertidal environment of central Chile was studied. Human exclusion from a rocky intertidal stretch of coast (non-harvested area) at Punta El Lacho, for nearly two years, resulted in a substantial density increase of the economically important high trophic level predator muricid Concholepas concholepas. This was followed by a dramatic decline in the cover of the competitive dominant intertidal mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. According to current ecological theory the removal of the competitively superior primary space dominant species led to a pattern of increasing species diversity. We conclude that in the absence of human interference C. concholepas plays the role of a key species in central Chile rocky intertidal environments. We suggest that the interpretation of the structure and dynamics of intertidal landscapes should include the key role played by man.

  abstract = {What the current policy debate on marine protected areas (MPAs) and marine reserves (MRs) has failed to address is the fact that protection of the marine environment has as much to do with scientists, and others values as it has to do with science. To date natural science has played a dominant role in the implementation of MPAs, yet normative considerations which are embedded in the way scientists and the wider community think about the condition the marine environment should be in, and which may influence decision-making, are rarely acknowledged or discussed. This paper seeks to correct that deficiency by investigating the values that lie behind the natural science of MPAs. With the aid of epistemic community, advocacy coalition and discourse coalition theories of policy networks, this article explores the role science and scientists have played in influencing policy on MPAs at the global and national level, and looks at the extent to which normative conceptualisations within and beyond natural science have influenced the debate.},

A national survey of small-boat fishermen was distributed to: (1) identify major defining characteristics of participants in ITQ and non-ITQ fisheries, (2) document and examine differences in satisfaction with fisheries management, and (3) evaluate the existing options for newcomers to participate in small-boat fisheries. Survey results indicate that Icelandic small-boat fishermen are engaged in multiple management systems within a wide range of boat sizes. Those who held quota were more satisfied with the current ITQ system compared to those who did not hold quota; however, nearly all fishermen were still critical of fisheries management in Iceland and the two major non-ITQ options of lumpfish and coastal fishing were not perceived to offer significant opportunity for entry-level fishermen. Dissatisfaction stemmed from the lack of decision-making power, a distrust of scientific advice, and the perception that the ITQ system did not serve the purpose of protecting fisheries resources, but was rather oriented only toward economic goals. The dynamic nature of Icelandic small-boat fishing livelihoods and the pervasive negative attitudes thirty years after ITQ implementation demonstrate the need for culturally appropriate and equitable fisheries management schemes where success is measured in social as well as economic and biological terms.},

The distribution of OA exposure across these early-impact systems, however, is highly uncertain and limits our understanding of whether and how spatial management actions can be deployed to ameliorate future impacts. Through a novel coastal OA observing network, we have uncovered a remarkably persistent spatial mosaic in the penetration of acidified waters into ecologically-important nearshore habitats across 1,000\,km of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. In the most severe exposure hotspots, suboptimal conditions for calcifying organisms encompassed up to 56\% of the summer season, and were accompanied by some of the lowest and most variable pH environments known for the surface ocean. Persistent refuge areas were also found, highlighting new opportunities for local adaptation to address the global challenge of OA in productive coastal systems.},

Two major concerns exist with the current governance of this fishery. First, Pacific island countries receive only a small share of the resource rents from the tuna fisheries. Second, the current management structure of the fisheries will not ensure the long-term sustainability of the resources. This paper derives a model to show that the sustainability of the resource can be improved when a single policymaker acts as Stackelberg leader and sets a tax, or an equivalent quantity instrument, to maximize rents from the resource. A practical institutional mechanism is presented that mimics the model's rent maximization outcome and that offers substantial benefits to both Pacific island countries and distant water fishing nations.},

Some aspects of its biological information have been well documented yet its population dynamics is poorly known. The objective of this study is to assess the population status of the shortfin mako in the Northwest Pacific. The whole weights of 68,943 female and 64,338 male shortfin mako landed at Nanfangao and Chengkung fish markets, eastern Taiwan from 1990 to 2004 were converted to total length and the age for each individual was estimated based on the sex-specific von Bertalanffy growth equation. Total mortality obtained with length-converted catch curves ranged from 0.175yr-1 to 0.272yr-1 for females and from 0.196yr-1 to 0.286yr-1 for males. Natural mortality estimated from Peterson and Wroblewski's equation were 0.077\textendash{}0.244yr-1 for females and 0.091\textendash{}0.203yr-1 for males. Based on virtual population analysis, the highest fishing mortality occurred in ages 6\textendash{}10 years for females and 7\textendash{}12 years for males. Increases of fishing mortality in ages 3\textendash{}5 years for females and 3\textendash{}6 years for males since 1996 indicated that the young shortfin mako experienced higher fishing pressure in recent years. Both deterministic and stochastic simulations showed that annual spawning potential ratio (SPR) of shortfin mako was lower than the biological reference point (BRP) of SPR 35\% and had a decreasing trend since 2000. Current fishing mortality (0.066yr-1) was greater than the BRP of F30\% (0.052yr-1), F35\% (0.045yr-1), F40\% (0.04yr-1) and F0.1 (0.063yr-1) suggesting that this stock might have been overexploited. Therefore, to ensure sustainable utilization, a management measure of 32\% reduction of current fishing effort was suggested for the shortfin mako stock in the Northwest Pacific.},

These areas represent one of the most significant human resource use allocations on the planet. The importance of protected areas is reflected in their widely accepted role as an indicator for global targets and environmental assessments.
However, measuring the number and extent of protected areas only provides a unidimensional indicator of political commitment to biodiversity conservation. Data on the geographic location and spatial extent of protected areas will not provide information on a key determinant for meeting global biodiversity targets: `effectiveness' in conserving biodiversity. Although tools are being devised to assess management effectiveness, there is no globally accepted metric.
Nevertheless, the numerical, spatial and geographic attributes of protected areas can be further enhanced by investigation of the biodiversity coverage of these protected areas, using species, habitats or biogeographic classifications.
This paper reviews the current global extent of protected areas in terms of geopolitical and habitat coverage, and considers their value as a global indicator of conservation action or response. The paper discusses the role of the World Database on Protected Areas and collection and quality control issues, and identifies areas for improvement, including how conservation effectiveness indicators may be included in the database to improve the value of protected areas data as an indicator for meeting global biodiversity targets.},

With the geometric age distribution there is no unbiased estimate of i, the instantaneous mortality rate, but a nearly unbiased estimate is given by i* = ln [1 + \={X} - (1/n)] - ln \={X} - [(n - 1)(n - 2)/n(t + 1)(n + t - 1)] where t = n\={X}.},

While the population dynamics of fish stocks have received considerable attention in the ecological literature, the dynamics of human communities dependent on the fishery are equally important. Indeed the joint dynamics of the fish stocks and the fishermen must be taken into account in determining appropriate management policies. A bio-socio-economic modelling approach is developed here to incorporate these effects within a multi-objective optimization framework. Fishery labour dynamics are determined by the decisions of individual fishermen with net migration into and out of the fishery (and hence the fishing community) dependent on internal conditions such as per capita incomes and employment rates, as well as on the state of the external economy.

  abstract = {Increasing recognition of the human dimensions of natural resource management issues, and of social and ecological sustainability and resilience as being inter-related, highlights the importance of applying social science to natural resource management decision-making. Moreover, a number of laws and regulations require natural resource management agencies to consider the ``best available science'' (BAS) when making decisions, including social science. Yet rarely do these laws and regulations define or identify standards for BAS, and those who have tried to fill the gap have done so from the standpoint of best available natural science. This paper proposes evaluative criteria for best available social science (BASS), explaining why a broader set of criteria than those used for natural science is needed. Although the natural and social sciences share many of the same evaluative criteria for BAS, they also exhibit some differences, especially where qualitative social science is concerned. Thus we argue that the evaluative criteria for BAS should expand to include those associated with diverse social science disciplines, particularly the qualitative social sciences. We provide one example from the USA of how a federal agency - the U.S. Forest Service - has attempted to incorporate BASS in responding to its BAS mandate associated with the national forest planning process, drawing on different types of scientific information and in light of these criteria. Greater attention to including BASS in natural resource management decision-making can contribute to better, more equitable, and more defensible management decisions and policies.},

Over the last 20 years, the Collie-Sissenwine (catch-survey) model has been used in estimating fishing mortality in the fishery. This is then compared with a biological reference point derived from an egg-per-recruitment model for determining the status of the stock. However, the complexity of the fishery and population biology for American lobster, data limitations, and uncertainty about underlying parameters call for the development of stock assessment models with more biological detail. Complex and simple modelling approaches are complementary and both are likely to remain useful for such an important and complex fishery. The objective of this study is to develop a size-structured stock assessment model for the American lobster. The proposed stock assessment model includes a set of size-structured, seasonal, and sex-specific population dynamics models and a statistical approach incorporating data of different sources. Using a fishery simulation based on the information on the lobster fishery in the Gulf of Maine, we evaluated the performance of the proposed model in the presence of biased errors in various model variables. This study suggests that the proposed stock assessment model performs well in retrieving the population dynamics of the simulated lobster and is rather robust to the biased errors in growth, fishing selectivity, and landings. Future studies need to focus on the evaluation of the model performance under different scenarios with both biased and random errors.},

We show how resource selection functions can be used to describe habitat suitability with continuous and multivariable metrics and review methods by which animal movement can be quantified, analyzed, and modeled.

Simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60\% of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services.

Here, we project changes in global catch potential for 1066 species of exploited marine fish and invertebrates from 2005 to 2055 under climate change scenarios. We show that climate change may lead to large-scale redistribution of global catch potential, with an average of 30\textendash{}70\% increase in high-latitude regions and a drop of up to 40\% in the tropics. Moreover, maximum catch potential declines considerably in the southward margins of semienclosed seas while it increases in poleward tips of continental shelf margins. Such changes are most apparent in the Pacific Ocean. Among the 20 most important fishing Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) regions in terms of their total landings, EEZ regions with the highest increase in catch potential by 2055 include Norway, Greenland, the United States (Alaska) and Russia (Asia). On the contrary, EEZ regions with the biggest loss in maximum catch potential include Indonesia, the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii), Chile and China. Many highly impacted regions, particularly those in the tropics, are socioeconomically vulnerable to these changes. Thus, our results indicate the need to develop adaptation policy that could minimize climate change impacts through fisheries. The study also provides information that may be useful to evaluate fisheries management options under climate change.},

This approach enables full posterior inference including point and interval estimates of the unknown regression function as well as the marginal effects of potential predictors. By keeping track of predictor inclusion frequencies, BART can also be used for model-free variable selection. BART's many features are illustrated with a bake-off against competing methods on 42 different data sets, with a simulation experiment and on a drug discovery classification problem.},

  abstract = {The designation of no-take marine reserves involves social and economic concerns due to the resulting displacement of fishing effort, when fishing rights are removed from those who traditionally fished within an area. Displacement can influence the functioning of the fishery and success of the reserve, yet levels of displacement are seldom quantified after reserve implementation and very rarely before that. We devised a simple analytical framework based on set theory to facilitate reserve placement. Implementation of the framework requires maps of fishing grounds, fishing effort, or catch per unit effort for at least 2 years. The framework quantifies the level of conflict that a reserve designation might cause in the fishing sector due to displacement and the opportunities to offset the conflict through fisher spatial mobility (i.e., ability of fishers to fish elsewhere). We also considered how the outputs of the framework can be used to identify targeted management interventions for each fishery. We applied the method in Honduras, where the largest marine protected area in Central America is being placed, for which spatial data on fishing effort were available for 6 fisheries over 3 years. The proposed closure had a greater negative impact on the shrimp and lobster scuba fisheries, which concentrated respectively 28\% and 18\% of their effort inside the reserve. These fisheries could not accommodate the displacement within existing fishing grounds. Both would be forced to stretch into new fishing grounds, which are available but are of unknown quality. These stakeholders will likely require compensation to offset costly exploratory fishing or to travel to fishing grounds farther away from port.},

  abstract = {Bayesian statistical modeling has several benefits within an ecological context. In particular, when observed data are limited in sample size or representativeness, then the Bayesian framework provides a mechanism to combine observed data with other ``prior'' information. Prior information may be obtained from earlier studies, or in their absence, from expert knowledge. This use of the Bayesian framework reflects the scientific ``learning cycle,'' where prior or initial estimates are updated when new data become available. In this paper we outline a framework for statistical design of expert elicitation processes for quantifying such expert knowledge, in a form suitable for input as prior information into Bayesian models. We identify six key elements: determining the purpose and motivation for using prior information; specifying the relevant expert knowledge available; formulating the statistical model; designing effective and efficient numerical encoding; managing uncertainty; and designing a practical elicitation protocol. We demonstrate this framework applies to a variety of situations, with two examples from the ecological literature and three from our experience. Analysis of these examples reveals several recurring important issues affecting practical design of elicitation in ecological problems.},

An aspect of this, which is rarely considered, is the spin-off effect of different fisheries: the economic and social benefits that fisheries generate through processing through distribution and on to the end consumer. This study evaluated the benefits generated in the Peruvian marine fisheries sector through a comprehensive value chain analysis, based on a newly-developed combined ecosystem-economic modeling approach, which was integrated in the widely-used Ecopath with Ecosim approach and software. The value chain was parameterized by extensive data collection through 35 enterprise types covering the marine fisheries sector in Peru, including the world's biggest single-species fishery for anchoveta. While anchoveta is what is known about Peruvian fisheries, the study finds that anchoveta accounts for only 31\% of the sector contribution to GDP and for only 23\% of the employment. Thus, while anchoveta indeed is the fundamental fish species in the Peruvian ecosystem, there are other fisheries to be considered for management. The study indicates that the economic multipliers for Peruvian fisheries were 2.9 on average over the industry, and that these varied surprisingly little between fleets and between seafood categories indicating that the multipliers can be used beyond Peru to generalize the spin-off effect of the value chain. Employment multipliers vary much more across types of fisheries, but also around an average of 2.9; here it was clear that longer value chains result in more employment.},

This study provides an overview of the global status of ITQ programmes, the reasons they have been adopted and the changes in stock biomass after their implementation. Eighteen countries currently use ITQs to manage several hundred stocks of at least 249 species. ITQs were adopted in these countries for many reasons: overcapitalization, economic gains, safety concerns for fishers and political change. The implementation of ITQs does not translate into consistent changes in stock biomass. Improvements in 12 of 20 stocks after ITQs were introduced suggest that ITQs can be an effective component of fisheries management strategies, but eight of the stocks continued to decline after ITQs were introduced. This suggests that alternative or complementary measures are needed to sustain those fisheries, such as combining ITQs with more effective total allowable catches, better enforcement and monitoring, and implementing aspects of ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

The current lack of negative perceptions toward co-management provides a critical window of opportunity to strengthen local governance institutions by investing in leadership capacity, transparency, and enforcement. This newly acquired authority to capture the benefits from local management resulted in an unexpected proliferation of community-based marine reserves \textendash{} a substantial change to the anti-reserve discourse that halted the government's most recent attempt to establish a national marine reserve. Several community-based reserves showed increases in fish biomass and coral cover, while others did not and likely suffered from poor compliance and weak management.

A presently unexplored approach that draws on theory and practice in human health and rural development is to systematically identify and learn from the `outliers'\textemdash{}places where ecosystems are substantially better (`bright spots') or worse (`dark spots') than expected, given the environmental conditions and socioeconomic drivers they are exposed to. Here we compile data from more than 2,500 reefs worldwide and develop a Bayesian hierarchical model to generate expectations of how standing stocks of reef fish biomass are related to 18 socioeconomic drivers and environmental conditions. We identify 15 bright spots and 35 dark spots among our global survey of coral reefs, defined as sites that have biomass levels more than two standard deviations from expectations. Importantly, bright spots are not simply comprised of remote areas with low fishing pressure; they include localities where human populations and use of ecosystem resources is high, potentially providing insights into how communities have successfully confronted strong drivers of change. Conversely, dark spots are not necessarily the sites with the lowest absolute biomass and even include some remote, uninhabited locations often considered near pristine. We surveyed local experts about social, institutional, and environmental conditions at these sites to reveal that bright spots are characterized by strong sociocultural institutions such as customary taboos and marine tenure, high levels of local engagement in management, high dependence on marine resources, and beneficial environmental conditions such as deep-water refuges. Alternatively, dark spots are characterized by intensive capture and storage technology and a recent history of environmental shocks. Our results suggest that investments in strengthening fisheries governance, particularly aspects such as participation and property rights, could facilitate innovative conservation actions that help communities defy expectations of global reef degradation.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs provide ecosystem goods and services for millions of people in the tropics, but reef conditions are declining worldwide. Effective solutions to the crisis facing coral reefs depend in part on understanding the context under which different types of conservation benefits can be maximized. Our global analysis of nearly 1,800 tropical reefs reveals how the intensity of human impacts in the surrounding seascape, measured as a function of human population size and accessibility to reefs (``gravity''), diminishes the effectiveness of marine reserves at sustaining reef fish biomass and the presence of top predators, even where compliance with reserve rules is high. Critically, fish biomass in high-compliance marine reserves located where human impacts were intensive tended to be less than a quarter that of reserves where human impacts were low. Similarly, the probability of encountering top predators on reefs with high human impacts was close to zero, even in high-compliance marine reserves. However, we find that the relative difference between openly fished sites and reserves (what we refer to as conservation gains) are highest for fish biomass (excluding predators) where human impacts are moderate and for top predators where human impacts are low. Our results illustrate critical ecological trade-offs in meeting key conservation objectives: reserves placed where there are moderate-to-high human impacts can provide substantial conservation gains for fish biomass, yet they are unlikely to support key ecosystem functions like higher-order predation, which is more prevalent in reserve locations with low human impacts.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty coming from assessment models leads to risk in decision making and ignoring or misestimating it can result in an erroneous management action. Some parameters, such as selectivity or survey catchabilities, can present a wide range of shapes and the introduction of smooth functions, which up to now have not been widely used in assessment models, allows for more flexibility to capture underlying nonlinear structures. In this work a simulation study emulating a sardine population is carried out to compare three different methods for uncertainty estimation: multivariate normal distribution, bootstrap (without and with relative bias correction) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In order to study their performance depending on the model complexity, five different scenarios are defined depending on the shape of the smooth function of the fishing mortality. From 100 simulated datasets, performance is measured in terms of point estimation, coefficients of variation, bias, skewness, coverage probabilities, and correlation. In all approaches model fitting is carried out using the a4a framework. All three methods result in very similar performance. The main differences are found for observation variance parameters where the bootstrap and the multivariate normal approach result in underestimation of these parameters. In general, MCMC is considered to have better performance, being able to detect skewness, showing small relative bias and reaching expected coverage probabilities. It is also more efficient in terms of time consumption in comparison with bootstrapping.},

  abstract = {The abundance of many stocks is estimated by fitting an age-structured model to catch-at-age and relative abundance data from the commercial fishery and scientific surveys. The natural mortality rate used in the model is usually estimated externally and its value is uncertain. An erroneous natural mortality rate will bias the stock size estimates obtained by fitting the model and will also bias the yield calculations that are done to choose a harvest rate and recommend quotas. This paper describes the general features of both effects by analyzing a simple age-structured model fitted to artificial data. It is shown that an erroneous natural mortality rate mainly affects the estimates of fishing mortality and hence abundance but not the estimates of age-specific selectivity. Errors in estimated abundance and target harvest rate are always in the same direction, with the result that, in the short term, extremely high exploitation rates can be recommended (unintentionally) in cases where the natural mortality rate is overestimated and historical exploitation rates in the catch-at-age data are low. A conservative (low) estimate of natural mortality can avoid that danger. Long-term yield under either an FMSY or F35\% strategy is not very sensitive to error in natural mortality rate unless it is grossly underestimated.},

However, payments used to buy out excess fishing capacity are often represented as useful subsidies, on the grounds that overcapacity encourages overfishing and causes economic waste.

In this paper we take the latter argument further, and demonstrate that buyback subsidies, if they come to be anticipated by fishermen, will generally have a negative effect on economic performance and resource conservation. Consequently, buyback subsidies are perhaps over-rated as a management tool.},

Although many ecological observation series are even shorter, perhaps fewer than ten sequential observations, these shorter time series are often highly replicated in space (i.e., plot replication). Here, we combine the existing techniques of convergent cross mapping (CCM) and dewdrop regression to build a novel test of causal relations that leverages spatial replication, which we call multispatial CCM. Using examples from simulated and real-world ecological data, we test the ability of multispatial CCM to detect causal relationships between processes. We find that multispatial CCM successfully detects causal relationships with as few as five sequential observations, even in the presence of process noise and observation error. Our results suggest that this technique may constitute a useful test for causality in systems where experiments are difficult to perform and long time series are not available. This new technique is available in the multispatialCCM package for the R programming language.},

Using 58 datasets from 19 European marine reserves, we show that reserve size and age do matter: Increasing the size of the no-take zone increases the density of commercial fishes within the reserve compared with outside; whereas the size of the buffer zone has the opposite effect. Moreover, positive effects of marine reserve on commercial fish species and species richness are linked to the time elapsed since the establishment of the protection scheme. The reserve size-dependency of the response to protection has strong implications for the spatial management of coastal areas because marine reserves are used for spatial zoning.},

Forage fish populations support large scale fisheries and are key components of marine ecosystems across the world, linking secondary production to higher trophic levels. While climate-induced changes in the North Sea zooplankton community are described and documented in literature, the associated bottom-up effects and consequences for fisheries remain largely unidentified.

*
We investigated the temporal development in forage fish productivity and the associated influence on fisheries yield of herring, sprat, Norway pout and sandeel in the North Sea. Using principal component analysis, we analysed 40~years of recruitment success and growth proxies to reveal changes in productivity and patterns of synchroneity across stocks (i.e. functional complementarity). The relationship between forage fish production and Calanus finmarchicus (an indicator of climate change) was also analysed. We used a population model to demonstrate how observed shifts in productivity affected total forage fish biomass and fisheries yield.

*
The productivity of North Sea forage fish changed around 1993 from a higher average productivity to lower average productivity. During the higher productivity period, stocks displayed a covariance structure indicative of functional complementarity. Calanus finmarchicus was positively correlated to forage fish recruitment, however, for growth, the direction of the response differed between species and time periods. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and the associated fishing mortality (Fmsy) decreased by 33\%\textendash{}68\% and 26\%\textendash{}64\%, respectively, between the higher and lower productivity periods.

*
Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrate that fisheries reference points for short-lived planktivorous species are highly dynamic and respond rapidly to changes in system productivity. Furthermore, from an ecosystem-based fisheries management perspective, a link between functional complementarity and productivity, indicates that ecosystem resilience may decline with productivity. Based on this, we advise that system productivity, perhaps monitored as forage fish growth, becomes an integral part of management reference points; in both single species and ecosystem contexts. However, to retain social license of biological advice when fish catch opportunities are reduced, it is crucial that shifts in productivity are thoroughly documented and made apparent to managers and stakeholders.},

Marine and coastal aquaculture, collectively referred to as mariculture, currently represents just 36\% of aquaculture production but is poised to expand in the decades ahead. One of the most commonly cited concerns regarding this likely expansion is ecological and socioeconomic interactions with wild-capture fisheries. While attention has largely been drawn to high-profile negative externalities from fed finfish and crustacean mariculture, not all marine-based practices are equivalent. Empirical evidence for the different interactions between mariculture and wild fisheries is often sparse. While negative consequences can arise, positive synergies can also occur. By considering mariculture development in the context of fisheries interactions, we suggest that it is possible to minimize conflicts and maximize positive connections between the two sectors. We provide the first comprehensive synthesis of the interactions between mariculture and wild fisheries, characterizing the types of interactions, evaluating available empirical evidence and identifying where management (sector-specific and cooperative) can play an important role. We highlight potential effects of mariculture on the efficiency, sustainability, and equity of seafood production and identify remaining knowledge gaps.},

In aquaculture \textendash{} a rapidly growing and highly scrutinized field \textendash{} the issue of such journals remains undocumented. We employed a quantitative approach to determine whether attributes of scientific quality and rigor differed between OA aquaculture journals not indexed in reputable databases and well-established, indexed journals. Using a Google search, we identified several non-indexed OA journals, gathered data on attributes of these journals and articles therein, and compared these data to well-established aquaculture journals indexed in quality-controlled bibliometric databases. We then used these data to determine if non-indexed journals were likely predatory OA journals and if they pose a potential threat to aquaculture research. On average, non-indexed OA journals published significantly fewer papers per year, had cheaper fees, and were more recently established than indexed journals. Articles in non-indexed journals were, on average, shorter, had fewer authors and references, and spent significantly less time in peer review than their indexed counterparts; the proportion of articles employing rigorous statistical analyses was also lower for non-indexed journals. Additionally, articles in non-indexed journals were more likely to be published by scientists from developing nations. Worryingly, non-indexed journals were more likely to be found using a Google search, and their articles superficially resembled those in indexed journals. These results suggest that the non-indexed aquaculture journals identified herein are likely predatory OA journals and pose a threat to aquaculture research and the public education and perception of aquaculture.

For larger problems where sampling is required, we provide conditions under which BAS provides perfect samples without replacement. When the sampling probabilities in the algorithm are the marginal variable inclusion probabilities, BAS may be viewed as sampling models ``near'' the median probability model of Barbieri and Berger. As marginal inclusion probabilities are not known in advance, we discuss several strategies to estimate adaptively the marginal inclusion probabilities within BAS. We illustrate the performance of the algorithm using simulated and real data and show that BAS can outperform Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The algorithm is implemented in the R package BAS available at CRAN. This article has supplementary material online.},

  abstract = {Concern about the global state of fisheries and fish resources has highlighted the three primary considerations in fisheries management: sustainable utilisation, economic efficiency and equity in access to resources. We appear to be failing in pursuit of all three goals. Living marine resources are particularly threatened by overfishing, leading to many of the world's fish stocks being heavily, fully or over exploited. Similarly, the economic diagnosis is that costs of fishing exceeded the value of the world's catch by about US\$ 40 billion at the beginning of the decade. Statistics on equity are less available, but the necessary spread of limited access to fisheries frequently has the greatest impact on the small scale, traditional fisher. This paper considers the reasons underlying the general failure of fisheries management and the solutions that are being proposed. Factors contributing to the problems include high biological uncertainty, conflict between the constraint of sustainability and social and economic priorities, poorly defined objectives, and institutional failures related to access rights and participation in management by the users. These issues point to the real complexity of fisheries management. It is argued that this complexity can be abused by all interest groups to avoid responsibility and to suit their own objectives. It is suggested that there are eight simple principles controlling fisheries management that are generally well-understood and, if properly considered in fisheries management systems, would lead to improved performances. Responsible management will, however, only be effective if there is a genuine desire to achieve the objectives. Fishing capacity, frequently reflecting dependency of users on fisheries resources, is commonly in excess of the sustainable production of the resources. Excess dependency can preclude the political will to consider alternative strategies and only once it has been overcome, probably requiring solutions borrowed from outside fisheries, is effective management likely to be considered seriously. Thereafter, responsible management requires setting unambiguous objectives and management measures in co-operation with users and other interest groups. The agreed strategy must be included in legislation to ensure transparency and accountability and to constrain decision-makers. The performance of the strategy must be monitored and revised as necessary.},

Ranking the ecological relative status of exploited marine ecosystems. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 769\textendash{}786. A set of simple, data-based ecological indicators was used to rank exploited ecosystems regarding fishing impacts with respect to their status, trends, and ecosystem EAF attributes. Expected theoretical changes in indicators with respect to increasing fishing impacts were considered, and ecosystems were compared by examining the mean values of indicators in the most recent three years for which data were available and over time (1980\textendash{}2005 and 1996\textendash{}2005). Systems were classified into nine potential categories according to whether they were most, moderately, or least impacted, and whether they were becoming more or less impacted, or remaining stationary. The responses of ecological indicators to additional environmental and socio-economic explanatory factors were tested. Ecosystems ranked using short- and long-term trends and states differed because of differences in trends, underscoring the importance of analysing both states and trends in ecosystem analyses. The number of ecosystems classified as unclear or intermediately impacted has increased recently, the proportion of ecosystems classified as less strongly impacted has been maintained, but more now fall within the category more strongly impacted in terms of long-term trends and states. Ecosystem type, fisheries enforcement, primary production, sea temperature, and fishing type were important variables explaining the ecological indicators. The results reflect different changes and processes in the ecosystems, demonstrating that information on ecological, environmental, and fishery histories is crucial to interpreting indicators correctly, while disentangling the effects of fishing and of the environment.},

  abstract = {The advent of an ecosystem-based approach dramatically expanded the scope of fisheries management, creating a critical need for new kinds of data and quantitative approaches that could be integrated into the management system. Ecosystem models are needed to codify the relationships among drivers, pressures and resulting states, and to quantify the trade-offs between conflicting objectives. Incorporating ecosystem considerations requires moving from the single-species models used in stock assessments, to more complex models that include species interactions, environmental drivers and human consequences. With this increasing model complexity, model fit can improve, but parameter uncertainty increases. At intermediate levels of complexity, there is a `sweet spot' at which the uncertainty in policy indicators is at a minimum. Finding the sweet spot in models requires compromises: for example, to include additional component species, the models of each species have in some cases been simplified from age-structured to logistic or bioenergetic models. In this paper, we illuminate the characteristics, capabilities and short-comings of the various modelling approaches being proposed for ecosystem-based fisheries management. We identify key ecosystem needs in fisheries management and indicate which types of models can meet these needs. Ecosystem models have been playing strategic roles by providing an ecosystem context for single-species management decisions. However, conventional stock assessments are being increasingly challenged by changing natural mortality rates and environmentally driven changes in productivity that are observed in many fish stocks. Thus, there is a need for more tactical ecosystem models that can respond dynamically to changing ecological and environmental conditions.},

  abstract = {Monthly visual surveys of reef fish populations in the Florida Keys were conducted from May to September of 1999 and April to December of 2000 using both strip transect and stationary point count sampling methods. Each month divers using SCUBA conducted three 10 m \texttimes{} 30 m transect surveys and three 5 m radius stationary point counts at 26 sites selected using a habitat based, stratified random design procedure. During both sampling procedures divers enumerated and assigned to 5 cm size increments all groupers (Serranidae), snappers (Lutjanidae), hogfish (Labridae), angelfish (Pomacanthidae), butterflyfish (Chaetodontidae), triggerfish (Balistidae), and a few other species of recreational or commercial importance. The rationale behind this sampling design was to assess the differential vulnerability of the various species and size classes to the lower behavioral disturbance/smaller area point count technique as compared to the higher disturbance/larger area transect method, and to assess which method would produce the highest density estimates and census the largest number of individuals per unit of sampling effort for size structure determinations. Although both types of samples required about the same amount of diver effort to complete, approximately 1.5 times more individuals were recorded during transect surveys. However, since transect surveys encompassed 4.3 times as much area as point counts, observed densities averaged about three times higher for point count samples. There was considerable variation among species with respect to this pattern, with total numbers of individuals for the 10 most abundant species ranging from about equal to 4.5 times higher during transect surveys, while densities ranged from nearly equal to about 6 times higher during point counts. Length frequencies within species were generally very similar between the two methods, though a higher proportion of larger individuals was recorded for a few species during transect surveys. Since previous studies have strongly indicated that visual census techniques produce underestimates of true reef fish densities, the higher and presumably more accurate density estimates provided by the point count method, along with other factors such as presumed increases in accuracy of counts and size estimates associated with increased observation time of individual fishes, led us to select this method for our future surveys.},

As the magnitude and speed of climate change accelerates, greater understanding of the taxonomy and geography of climatic vulnerability is critical to guide effective conservation action. However, many uncertainties remain regarding the degree and variability of climatic risk within entire clades and across vast ecosystem boundaries. Here we integrate physiological estimates of thermal sensitivity for 2,960 ray-finned fishes with future climatic exposure, and demonstrate that global patterns of vulnerability differ substantially between freshwater and marine realms. Our results suggest that climatic vulnerability for freshwater faunas will be predominantly determined by elevated levels of climatic exposure predicted for the Northern Hemisphere, whereas marine faunas in the tropics will be the most at risk, reflecting their higher intrinsic sensitivity. Spatial overlap between areas of high physiological risk and high human impacts, together with evidence of low past rates of evolution in upper thermal tolerance, highlights the urgency of global conservation actions and policy initiatives if harmful climate effects on the world's fishes are to be mitigated in the future.},

While effect sizes of interest can be tested with frequentist methods, using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, probabilities of effect sizes, such as a {$\geq$}20~\% increase in density after restoration, can be directly estimated. Although BACI and Bayesian methods are used widely for assessing natural and human-induced impacts for field experiments, the application of hierarchal Bayesian modeling with MCMC sampling to BACI designs is less common. Here, we combine these approaches and extend the typical presentation of results with an easy to interpret ratio, which provides an answer to the main study question\textemdash{}``How much impact did a management action or natural perturbation have?'' As an example of this approach, we evaluate the impact of a restoration project, which implemented beaver dam analogs, on survival and density of juvenile steelhead. Results indicated the probabilities of a {$\geq$}30~\% increase were high for survival and density after the dams were installed, 0.88 and 0.99, respectively, while probabilities for a higher increase of {$\geq$}50~\% were variable, 0.17 and 0.82, respectively. This approach demonstrates a useful extension of Bayesian methods that can easily be generalized to other study designs from simple (e.g., single factor ANOVA, paired t test) to more complicated block designs (e.g., crossover, split-plot). This approach is valuable for estimating the probabilities of restoration impacts or other management actions.},

Other analyses, primarily based on catch data alone, but which include a wider range of species as well as bycatch, present a different view. Catch-only analyses could be more robust if fishery-independent data were used and discards accounted for. We develop a model that uses only survey biomass at length and landings data to estimate fishing mortality, spawning stock biomass (SSB) and discards. An analysis of species from the North Sea shows the model results compare well with most fully assessed stocks. When applied to bycatch species with limited data, trends in fishing mortality and SSB typically reflect those of the target species. In the last decade, mean fishing mortality rates have tended to decline, while mean SSB has increased. Despite increasing SSB, recent mean recruitment appears to have been lower than previously which may limit future biomass recovery. Species usually associated with more northerly distributions appear to show the greatest effect of weaker recruitment, which may be linked to climate. Estimated discards have tended to decline in magnitude as a result of reduced fishing mortality and associated lower total catches. The model offers a simple way to use both landings and survey data to obtain more detailed population trends for data limited species.},

  abstract = {Abstract Current fisheries management policies generally require an assessment of stock status, which is a difficult task when population and fisheries data are limited. Three simple metrics based on catch length compositions (i.e., that reflect exclusive take of mature individuals, P mat; that consist primarily of fish of optimal size, the size at which the highest yield from a cohort occurs, P opt; and that demonstrate the conservation of large, mature individuals, P mega) can be used to monitor population status relative to exploitation. The metrics (collectively referred to as Px ) were intended to avoid growth and recruitment overfishing, but there was no quantitative linkage to stock status and calculation of future sustainable catches. We attempt to make this connection by exploring the relationship of Px measures to fishing mortality and spawning biomass (SB). The relationships are compared specifically to the current target reference point (0.4 times the virgin, or unfished, SB [SB0]) and limit reference point (0.25SB0) used for the U.S. West Coast groundfish fishery by using simulations based on a deterministic age-structured population dynamics model. Sensitivity to fishery selectivity, life history traits, and recruitment compensation (steepness) is explored. Each Px measure showed a wide range of possible values depending on fishery selectivity, steepness, and the ratio of the length at maturity (L mat) to the optimal fishing length (L opt). Although the values of Px may be compatible with sustainable fishing, these values are not always sufficient to ensure stock protection from overfishing. Moreover, values for Px cannot be interpreted adequately without knowledge of the selectivity pattern. A new measure, P obj (the sum of P mat, P opt, and P mega), is introduced to distinguish selectivity patterns and construct a decision tree for development of stock status indicators. Heuristic indicator values are presented to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Although several caveats remain, this approach builds on the recommendations of previous literature by giving further guidance related to interpreting catch length composition data under variable fishery conditions without collecting additional information. It also provides a link to developing harvest control rules that inform proactive fisheries management under data-limited conditions.},

  abstract = {Spatial homogeneity is the exception, not the rule, for many marine populations. Data limitations or biological knowledge gaps, though, often drive the assumption of limited stock structuring; the subsequent mismatch of model spatial scale and biological stock structure may compromise management goals. Spatial considerations thus remain a major challenge in providing managers with the best information for responsible and responsive management. This study uses simulation testing to offer a quantitative evaluation of spatial stock structure assumptions on the performance of stock assessments relative to management scales. Catch histories, not biological differences, are used to create stock structure. Simulation testing is based on an operating model of `true' population states of nature that vary only in catch history across 9 regions. Stock assessments under various data scenarios are then performed on regions either as one aggregated assessment, or at finer area scales defined by zonal catch differences. The median absolute relative error of the terminal spawning biomass depletion is used as a performance statistic. One area stock assessments demonstrated low bias and high precision under all catch scenarios when stock structure is ignored, but perform poorly when applied to areas with differing regional catch histories. Separate area assessments grouped by zonal catch differences performed best under these circumstances, despite lower data quality, indicating the importance of identifying stock structure for management purposes. We suggest a focus on explicitly defining management units prior to conducting stock assessments with a concomitant resolve to increase data provisions at the resolution of management needs.},

While it is typically applied in data-rich circumstances, its suitability in data-limited situations is investigated in this work. Two ``Simple Stock Synthesis'' (SSS) approaches are outlined, each developed to mimic the Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) estimation of overfishing limits (OFLs) currently applied to data-limited U.S. west coast groundfish species. SSS-MC uses Monte Carlo draws of natural mortality, steepness, and stock depletion and estimates initial recruitment, while SSS-MCMC estimates natural mortality, steepness, and initial recruitment while fitting to an artificial abundance survey representing stock depletion with an error distribution equivalent to the stock depletion prior used in DB-SRA. These approaches are applied to 45 species of unassessed groundfishes in the Pacific Fishery Management Council Groundfish Fishery Management Plan, and the OFL estimates are compared to corresponding DB-SRA estimates. Despite model structure and parameter specification differences, SSS led to results comparable to DB-SRA over a wide range of species and life histories. SSS models with sex-specific life history parameters and growth variability are also presented as examples of how the inherent flexibility of SS can be used to account for more uncertainty in derived quantities. SSS-MCMC, while exhibiting statistically undesirable traits due to the inclusion of the artificial survey, readily includes data-informed abundance surveys into an assessment framework consistent with more complex, data-informed assessments. Establishment of viable data-limited approaches in SS is a convenient first steps in ``building-up'' stock assessments towards fuller implementation in SS when additional data become available, while also providing a way to inform management in data-limited situations.},

Recent developments in data-limited analytical methods have broadened the reach of science informing management. Existing approaches such as stock reduction analysis and its extensions offer simple ways to handle low data availability, but are particularly sensitive to assumptions regarding relative stock status. This study develops and introduces a prior on relative stock status using Productivity-Susceptibility Analysis vulnerability scores. Data from U.S. west coast groundfish stocks (n=17) were used to develop and then test the performance of the new relative stock status prior. Traditional simulation testing via an operating model was not possible because vulnerability scoring could not be simulated; we instead used the ``best available scientific information'' (BASI) approach. This approach uses fully-realized stock assessments (deemed the best available scientific information by management entities) and reduces data content available to simpler models. The Stock Synthesis statistical catch-at-age framework was used to nest within the full assessment two simpler models that rely on stock status priors. Relative error in derived estimates of biomass and stock status were then compared to the BASI assessment. In general, the new stock status prior improved performance over the current application of stock status assumed at 40\% initial biomass. Over all stocks combined, stock status showed the least amount of bias, while initial biomass was better estimated than current biomass. The BASI approach proved a useful and possibly complimentary approach to simulation testing with operating models in order to gain insight into modelling performance germane to management needs, particularly when system components (e.g., susceptibility scoring) cannot be easily simulated.},

  abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPA) are important management tools shown to protect marine organisms, restore biomass, and increase fisheries yields. While MPAs have been successful in meeting these goals for many relatively sedentary species, highly mobile organisms may get few benefits from this type of spatial protection due to their frequent movement outside the protected area. The use of a large MPA can compensate for extensive movement, but testing this empirically is challenging, as it requires both large areas and sufficient time series to draw conclusions. To overcome this limitation, MPA models have been used to identify designs and predict potential outcomes, but these simulations are highly sensitive to the assumptions describing the organism's movements. Due to recent improvements in computational simulations, it is now possible to include very complex movement assumptions in MPA models (e.g. Individual Based Model). These have renewed interest in MPA simulations, which implicitly assume that increasing the detail in fish movement overcomes the sensitivity to the movement assumptions. Nevertheless, a systematic comparison of the designs and outcomes obtained under different movement assumptions has not been done. In this paper, we use an individual based model, interconnected to population and fishing fleet models, to explore the value of increasing the detail of the movement assumptions using four scenarios of increasing behavioral complexity: a) random, diffusive movement, b) aggregations, c) aggregations that respond to environmental forcing (e.g. sea surface temperature), and d) aggregations that respond to environmental forcing and are transported by currents. We then compare these models to determine how the assumptions affect MPA design, and therefore the effective protection of the stocks. Our results show that the optimal MPA size to maximize fisheries benefits increases as movement complexity increases from \textasciitilde{}10\% for the diffusive assumption to \textasciitilde{}30\% when full environment forcing was used. We also found that in cases of limited understanding of the movement dynamics of a species, simplified assumptions can be used to provide a guide for the minimum MPA size needed to effectively protect the stock. However, using oversimplified assumptions can produce suboptimal designs and lead to a density underestimation of ca. 30\%; therefore, the main value of detailed movement dynamics is to provide more reliable MPA design and predicted outcomes. Large MPAs can be effective in recovering overfished stocks, protect pelagic fish and provide significant increases in fisheries yields. Our models provide a means to empirically test this spatial management tool, which theoretical evidence consistently suggests as an effective alternative to managing highly mobile pelagic stocks.},

Two hundred eighty Mexican citizens responded to a questionnaire investigating how they perceived that other individuals in their community wasted water. Respondents were also asked about their motives to conserve water, and direct observations of individual water consumption were recorded. Results were processed within a structural equations model, which revealed that motives to conserve water significantly inhibit water consumption. Since the perception of externalities also inhibits conservation motives, the resulting effect of PE on water consumption is positive. This result means that the more people perceive that others waste water, the less their conservation motives, and, therefore, the more their own water consumption.},

Two structural models of relations between general environmental beliefs, specific water beliefs and water consumption were specified and tested. The first model failed in producing direct effects of general environmental beliefs on water consumption. The second model revealed that general environmental beliefs differentially influenced the development of specific beliefs regarding water: Utilitarian water beliefs were positively affected by the HEP, while ecological water beliefs were positively influenced by ``limits'' beliefs and were negatively related to the HEP. Utilitarian water beliefs, in turn promoted water consumption, while the ecological water beliefs inhibited that behavior.},

I examine the interpretation of rmax by revisiting the theory behind the density-independent and density-dependent paradigms. The criticism that density-independent approaches underestimate rmax per se, often expressed in the field of fisheries, is shown to be theoretically unfounded. The difficulty in estimating rmax is due to lack of knowledge on the depletion level of the population rather than theory.

* I reviewed a method commonly used to estimate extinction risk of marine and terrestrial populations and show that it has been used incorrectly. I also examined five other methods to calculate rmax, the Euler\textendash{}Lotka equation, and four other methods derived from it.

* I used the same data inputs for a suite of 65 shark populations with a broad range of life histories as an example to show that the incorrectly used extinction risk method overestimates rmax. I compared the rmax values for sharks obtained with the incorrectly applied extinction risk method to published values for other vertebrate taxa to further show that this method generates implausible values for this group of predators.

* I advocate focusing on obtaining estimates of all required vital rates simultaneously when possible while taking into consideration the exploitation history of the population under study as a pragmatic way to provide plausible estimates of rmax.

* The Euler\textendash{}Lotka equation~and its derivations are recommended for different degrees of data availability, particularly for slow- and medium-growing populations, to provide sensible advice for conservation and management of living vertebrates in~situations where a series of credible abundance estimates are not available as is often the case in marine systems.

  abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been widely proposed as a fisheries management tool in addition to their conservation purposes. Despite this, few studies have satisfactorily assessed the dynamics of fishers' adaptations to the loss of fishing grounds. Here we used data from before, during and after the implementation of the management plan of a temperate Atlantic multiple-use MPA to examine the factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of different gears used by the artisanal fishing fleet. The position of vessels and gear types were obtained by visual surveys and related to spatial features of the marine park. A hotspot analysis was conducted to identify heavily utilized patches for each fishing gear and time period. The contribution of individual vessels to each significant cluster was assessed to better understand fishers' choices. Different fisheries responded differently to the implementation of protection measures, with preferred habitats of target species driving much of the fishers' choices. Within each fishery, individual fishers showed distinct strategies with some operating in a broader area whereas others kept preferred territories. Our findings are based on reliable methods that can easily be applied in coastal multipurpose MPAs to monitor and assess fisheries and fishers responses to different management rules and protection levels. This paper is the first in-depth empirical study where fishers' choices from artisanal fisheries were analysed before, during and after the implementation of a MPA, thereby allowing a clearer understanding of the dynamics of local fisheries and providing significant lessons for marine conservation and management of coastal systems.},

Global estimates expressed in monetary accounting units, such as this, are useful to highlight the magnitude of eco-services, but have no specific decision-making context. However, the underlying data and models can be applied at multiple scales to assess changes resulting from various scenarios and policies.

  abstract = {Variations in environmental conditions affect renewable resource growth. The ability to predict such variations is improving, providing scope for improved management. We generalize a common stochastic stock recruitment model to explore how optimal management changes with environmental prediction. We obtain three main results. First, while it might seem that a prediction of adverse future conditions should lead to more conservative management, the opposite may be true. Second, optimal management requires only a one-period-ahead forecast, suggesting forecast accuracy is more important than forecast lead time. Finally, we derive conditions on environmental fluctuations guaranteeing positive optimal harvest in every period.

  abstract = {Spatial property rights in the ocean, such as territorial user right fisheries (TURFs), are increasingly used to overcome the tragedy of the commons. TURFs engender vastly different fishing incentives than in a common pool race; while this likely enhances conservation beyond an open access setting, conservation organizations may desire even greater protection. We argue that because TURFs are property rights, their implementation opens the door for ``private conservation,'' for example, where a conservation organization would purchase a set of TURFs to create an un-fished marine reserve network. This possibility has interesting implications for biodiversity conservation, fishery management, and economic incentives, yet has received almost no attention in the literature. We examine this issue in a numerical spatial-dynamic bioeconomic fishery model. Among other novel findings, we show: (i) Private acquisition of TURFs is likely to be a relatively inexpensive marine conservation strategy, particularly if the conservationist can capture some of the ``conservation rents'' that accrue due to spillover; (ii) Accounting for the strategic response of remaining fishermen can significantly reduce the cost of conservation; and (iii) The degree of fishing cooperation across TURFs plays a pivotal role in the costs of conservation; more-cooperative TURF owners engage in more ``free'' conservation, dramatically reducing the overall costs of achieving a particular conservation target.},

Good governance seems to play a central role, and we summarize key findings from the literature on how effective fishery management can simultaneously increase food security, livelihoods, and conservation outcomes. Other solutions, such as marine protected areas and big data, can be useful but will not, by themselves, solve the main fishery challenges. We conclude by examining notorious threats, such as climate change and lack of governance on the high seas, and find that these can be largely neutralized with good fishery management, suggesting that overall, the future of wild fisheries can be bright with effective fishery management interventions.},

This basic economic insight has been validated empirically; transboundary fisheries tend to be in worse condition than fisheries in single nations. Attempts to solve this challenge through cross-country cooperation have been largely unsuccessful because competitive extraction is often more attractive than adhering to cooperative agreements. We explore the game-theoretic economics of an alternative solution, a transboundary marine protected area (TMPA), and derive the conditions under which it can improve profits and stock biomass, even in the presence of individually-rational non-cooperation across countries. We find that well-designed TMPAs have the potential to overcome non-cooperation across countries; this result is strengthened when stocks have relatively low growth rates. A TMPA can earn higher harvest benefits for both countries, increase stocks in both countries, and in many cases, can even reproduce the fully cooperative outcome.},

Overall, there was a slight (11\%) but significant increase in fish species number inside marine reserves, with all reserves sharing a common effect. There was a substantial but non-significant increase in overall fish abundance inside marine reserves compared to adjacent, non-reserve areas. When only species that are the target of fisheries were considered, fish abundance was significantly higher (by 28\%) within reserve boundaries. Marine reserves vary significantly in the extent and direction of their response. This variability in relative abundance was not attributable to differences in survey methodology among studies, nor correlated with reserve characteristics such as reserve area, years since protection, latitude nor species diversity. The effectiveness of marine reserves in enhancing fish abundance may be largely related to the intensity of exploitation outside reserve boundaries and to the composition of the fish community within boundaries. It is recommended that studies of marine reserve effectiveness should routinely report fishing intensity, effectiveness of enforcement and habitat characteristics.},

In particular, we note that although catastrophes are likely to have precipitated many extinctions, estimates of the probability of catastrophes are unreliable.},

While there is general agreement that this fishery is managed under principles that foster sustainability, the stock is not wholly contained within the US Exclusive Economic Zone. Management of straddling stocks can be highly contentious, particularly when, as is the case for pollock, the spatial distribution varies considerably. When the center of pollock abundance shifts to the northwest, an increased portion of the stock is exposed to harvest by vessels operating in the Russian Federation Exclusive Economic Zone. The lack of coordination in the management of this transboundary stock presents a risk that is not reflected in current management strategies. We use a multiple product/multiple market bioeconomic model to characterize optimal cooperative and non-cooperative harvest management strategies from the perspective of US and Russian pollock fisheries under environmentally induced changes in pollock abundance and the distribution of that abundance.},

This paper examines the usefulness of fish price as a feedback signal to consumers about the state of fisheries and marine ecosystems. We suggest that the current nature of fisheries systems and global markets prevent transmission of such price signals from source fisheries to consumers. We propose several mechanisms that combine to weaken price signals, and present one example \textendash{} the North Sea cod \textendash{} to show how these mechanisms can be tested. The lack of a reliable price feedback to consumers represents a challenge for sustainable fisheries governance. We therefore propose three complimentary approaches to address the missing feedback: (i) strengthening information flow through improved traceability and visibility of individual fishers to consumers, (ii) capitalizing on the changing seafood trade structures and (iii) bypassing and complementing market mechanisms by directly targeting citizens and political actors regarding marine environmental issues through publicity and information campaigns. These strategies each have~limitations and thus need to be pursued together to address the challenge of sustainability in global marine fisheries.},

Reciprocity has been invoked to explain gift exchange and labor market decisions. This paper describes a set of experiments, which distinguish between these competing theories by testing their comparative statics predictions in a linear public goods setting.

Ecosystems are places, so marine spatial planners and managers must understand the heterogeneity of biological communities and their key components (especially apex predators and structure-forming species), and of key processes (e.g., population connectivity, interaction webs, biogeochemistry) that maintain them, as well as heterogeneity of human uses. Maintaining resistance and resilience to stressors is crucial. Because marine populations and ecosystems exhibit complex system behaviors, managers cannot safely assume they will recover when stressors are reduced, so prevention is a far more robust management strategy than seeking a cure for degraded systems.},

Of these trees, approximately 1.30 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical forests, with 0.74 trillion in boreal regions and 0.66 trillion in temperate regions. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming effect of humans across most of the world.

The study area was stratified according to the topography, shape and orientation of the coastal line, and the survey was carried out on the continental shelf during the main spawning peak (August-September, 2002). The bulk of the spawning of both species was successfully covered, which was characterized by a coastal distribution within the first 20 nautical miles, and following the inner zone associated with the 100~m bottom depth. The coastal distribution of the spawning can be related to the oceanographic conditions occurring during the transition from winter to spring (southern Hemisphere), which are characterized by the alternation between northerly and southerly winds. Probably, these factors are interacting to produce enrichment, concentration and retention of egg in coastal zones in the study area. The daily egg production rate (P0) was estimated for two geographic strata, and was different in each region. Also, the length frequency and adult reproductive parameters were different between geographic strata, specially the daily spawning fraction. For anchovy, the P0 was lower in comparison with available estimates for the same species in Peru and in the north area off Chile. Also, the relative fecundity of anchovy was lower, probably because anchovy in the study area have bigger eggs as compared with the anchovy in Northern Chile. The DEPM parameters estimated for common sardine in the investigated area were similar to the range of existing values for the Engraulis genus in other upwelling areas. The stratified spawning stock biomass estimate was 133,031~t (CV~=~44\%) for anchovy and 706,792~t (CV~=~68\%) for common sardine. Probably, daily egg production and adult reproductive parameters of both species are highly variables and further research is suggested for improvements future DEPM application for the species.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Marine reserves have been advocated worldwide as conservation and fishery management tools. It is argued that they can protect ecosystems and also benefit fisheries via density-dependent spillover of adults and enhanced larval dispersal into fishing areas. However, while evidence has shown that marine reserves can meet conservation targets, their effects on fisheries are less understood. In particular, the basic question of if and over what temporal and spatial scales reserves can benefit fished populations via larval dispersal remains unanswered. We tested predictions of a larval transport model for a marine reserve network in the Gulf of California, Mexico, via field oceanography and repeated density counts of recently settled juvenile commercial mollusks before and after reserve establishment. We show that local retention of larvae within a reserve network can take place with enhanced, but spatially-explicit, recruitment to local fisheries. Enhancement occurred rapidly (2 yrs), with up to a three-fold increase in density of juveniles found in fished areas at the downstream edge of the reserve network, but other fishing areas within the network were unaffected. These findings were consistent with our model predictions. Our findings underscore the potential benefits of protecting larval sources and show that enhancement in recruitment can be manifested rapidly. However, benefits can be markedly variable within a local seascape. Hence, effects of marine reserve networks, positive or negative, may be overlooked when only focusing on overall responses and not considering finer spatially-explicit responses within a reserve network and its adjacent fishing grounds. Our results therefore call for future research on marine reserves that addresses this variability in order to help frame appropriate scenarios for the spatial management scales of interest.},

  abstract = {The use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) by purse seine fisheries has come under increasing criticism for its potential deleterious impacts on tuna stocks, for high levels of by-catch and threats to the biodiversity of tropical pelagic ecosystems. Here, we review the current state of scientific knowledge of this fishing technique and current management strategies. Our intent is to encourage objective discussion of the topic and highlight areas worthy of future research. We show that catching juvenile tuna around FADs does not necessarily result in overfishing of stocks, although more selective fishing techniques would likely help obtain higher yield. Levels of non-tuna by-catch are comparable to or less than in other commercial tuna fisheries and are primarily comprised of species that are not considered threatened. Accordingly, to minimize impacts on ecosystem balance, there is merit in considering that all species captured in purse seine fisheries (excluding vulnerable species such as turtles and sharks) should be retained, but the consequences of such a measure should be carefully examined before implementation. The take of vulnerable species could be further reduced by introduction of additional mitigation measures, but their potential benefits would be limited without parallel efforts with other gears. Finally, there is no unequivocal empirical evidence that FADs represent an `ecological trap' that inherently disrupts tuna biology although further research should focus on this issue. We encourage RFMOs to expand and improve their FAD management plans. Under appropriate management regimes, FAD fishing could be an ecologically and economically sensible fishing method.},

We mapped the bifurcation diagram experimentally and found that the populations became more vulnerable to disturbance closer to the tipping point. Fluctuations of population density increased in size and duration near the tipping point, in agreement with the theory. Our results suggest that indicators of critical slowing down can provide advance warning of catastrophic thresholds and loss of resilience in a variety of dynamical systems.

However, the complexity of many ecosystems presents a challenge to analysis, especially if reliant on quantification because of the onerous task of precisely measuring or estimating numerous parameters. We present qualitative modelling as a complementary approach to quantitative methods. Qualitative modelling clarifies how community structure alone affects dynamics, here of exploited populations. We build an array of models that describe different ecosystems with different harvesting practices, and analyse them to predict responses to various perturbations. This approach demonstrates the utility of qualitative modelling as a means to identify and interpret community-level indicators for systems that are at or near equilibrium, and for those that are frequently perturbed away from equilibrium. Examining the interaction of ecological and socio-economic variables associated with commercial fisheries provides an understanding of the main feedbacks that drive and regulate exploited ecosystems. The method is particularly useful for systems where the basic relationships between variables are understood but where precise or detailed data are lacking.},

Generally, an estimator should be more accurate than any benchmark that systematically ignores information about the relations among experimental conditions. We consider two such benchmark estimators: one that randomizes the relations among conditions and another that always assumes no treatment effects. We show conditions under which these benchmark estimators estimate the true parameters more accurately than sample means. This perverse situation can occur even when effects are statistically significant at traditional levels. Our argument motivates the need for regularized estimates, such as those used in lasso, ridge, and hierarchical Bayes techniques.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are an increasingly popular, but debated, management strategy to conserve marine biodiversity and ensure sustainable human use of the oceans. Economic studies can contribute to the debate about MPAs as a management option by evaluating their benefits and costs to society. In this paper, we outline how to evaluate the economic benefits and costs of MPAs and provide examples from the literature to demonstrate the methods described. We review challenges and opportunities of different economic methods. One key challenge is to meaningfully compare market and non-market benefits of MPAs\textemdash{}this comparison is complicated by the scarcity of studies that quantify the non-market benefits of MPAs. Another key challenge is to quantify how the value of marine areas may change with and without MPAs. Costs are often easier to estimate than benefits, but some costs\textemdash{}such as maintenance and compliance costs\textemdash{}are rarely recognized. Analytical choices will influence the identified economic costs and benefits of MPAs. For example, the spatial extent of analyses will influence what changes in underlying ecological processes are captured and conclusions about the equitable distribution of costs and benefits across society. For these reasons, it is important that managers are aware of the challenges and opportunities described here, so that they can obtain and use the best-quality economic information to guide decision making about MPAs.},

  abstract = {Objective To demonstrate regression to the mean bias introduced by matching on preperiod variables in difference-in-differences studies. Data Sources Simulated data. Study Design We performed a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the effect of a placebo intervention on simulated longitudinal data for units in treatment and control groups using unmatched and matched difference-in-differences analyses. We varied the preperiod level and trend differences between the treatment and control groups, and the serial correlation of the matching variables. We assessed estimator bias as the mean absolute deviation of estimated program effects from the true value of zero. Principal Findings When preperiod outcome level is correlated with treatment assignment, an unmatched analysis is unbiased, but matching units on preperiod outcome levels produces biased estimates. The bias increases with greater preperiod level differences and weaker serial correlation in the outcome. This problem extends to matching on preperiod level of a time-varying covariate. When treatment assignment is correlated with preperiod trend only, the unmatched analysis is biased, and matching units on preperiod level or trend does not introduce additional bias. Conclusions Researchers should be aware of the threat of regression to the mean when constructing matched samples for difference-in-differences. We provide guidance on when to incorporate matching in this study design.},

Although marine environments generally are not owned, those who use them for commercial fishing often are regulated. These regulations grant harvesters rights to use marine environments in specified ways, and the possibility of encumbering these rights to achieve conservation goals creates a potential role for marine easements. We examine this potential under alternative fishery management regimes and find, generally, that marine easements tend to be most effective when harvest rights are delineated most fully. Our analysis suggests ways that marine easements can have flexibility and transactions cost advantages over other approaches to achieve marine conservation goals. We also propose ways in which the design of laws allowing marine easements should follow, or depart from, the design of laws authorising conservation easements on land.},

We model the decision to join and behavior under cooperative and independent fishing. The data confirm our key predictions: the co-op attracted the least skilled fishermen, consolidated and coordinated effort among its most efficient members, and provided shared infrastructure. We estimate that resulting gains in rent were at least 33 percent. Some independents were disadvantaged by the co-op's formation, however, which prompted them to oppose it in court. We analyze the source of their disadvantage and provide guidance for designing fishery reform that leads to Pareto improvements, enabling reform without losers.},

  abstract = {In many applications of the differences-in-differences (DID) method, the treatment increases more in the treatment group, but some units are also treated in the control group. In such fuzzy designs, a popular estimator of treatment effects is the DID of the outcome divided by the DID of the treatment, or OLS and 2SLS regressions with time and group fixed effects estimating weighted averages of this ratio across groups. We start by showing that when the treatment also increases in the control group, this ratio estimates a causal effect only if treatment effects are homogenous in the two groups. Even when the distribution of treatment is stable, it requires that treatment effects be constant over time. As this assumption is not always applicable, we propose two alternative estimators. The first estimator relies on a generalization of common trends assumptions to fuzzy designs, while the second extends the changes-in-changes estimator of Athey and Imbens (2006). When the distribution of treatment changes in the control group, treatment effects are partially identified. Finally, we prove that our estimators are asymptotically normal and use them to revisit applied papers using fuzzy designs.},

How much biodiversity protection would result from this modified focus? Although biodiversity contributes to ecosystem services, the details of which species are critical, and whether they will go functionally extinct in the future, are fraught with uncertainty. Explicitly considering this uncertainty, we develop an analytical framework to determine how much biodiversity protection would arise solely from optimising net value from an ecosystem service. Using stochastic dynamic programming, we find that protecting a threshold number of species is optimal, and uncertainty surrounding how biodiversity produces services makes it optimal to protect more species than are presumed critical optimal. We define conditions under which the economically optimal protection strategy is to protect all species, no species, and cases in between. We show how the optimal number of species to protect depends upon different relationships between species and services, including considering multiple services. Our analysis provides simple criteria to evaluate when managing for particular ecosystem services could warrant protecting all species, given uncertainty. Evaluating this criterion with empirical estimates from different ecosystems suggests that optimising some services will be more likely to protect most species than others.},

  abstract = {Temperature variation within a year can impact biological processes driving population abundances. The implications for the ecosystem services these populations provide, including food production from marine fisheries, are poorly understood. Whether and how temperature variability impacts fishery yields may depend on the number of harvested species and differences in their responses to varying temperatures. Drawing from previous theoretical and empirical studies, we predict that greater temperature variability within years will reduce yields, but harvesting a larger number of species, especially a more functionally diverse set, will decrease this impact. Using a global marine fisheries dataset, we find that within-year temperature variability reduces yields, but current levels of functional diversity (FD) of targeted species, measured using traits related to species' responses to temperature, largely offset this effect. Globally, high FD of catch could avoid annual losses in yield of 6.8\% relative to projections if FD were degraded to the lowest level observed in the data. By contrast, species richness in the catch and in the ecosystem did not provide a similar mitigating effect. This work provides novel empirical evidence that short-term temperature variability can negatively impact the provisioning of ecosystem services, but that FD can buffer these negative impacts.},

We show drastic long-term and large-scale effects of climate variability, e.g., sea surface temperature anomalies, wind intensity, sea level, and climatic indices, on SSFs. These variables, acting in concert with economic drivers, have exacerbated stock depletion rates in Latin American SSFs. The impact of these drivers varied according to the life cycle and latitudinal distribution of the target species, the characteristics of the oceanographic systems, and the inherent features of the social systems. Our review highlights the urgent need to improve management and governance systems to promote resilience as a way to cope with the increasing uncertainty about the impacts of climate and globalization of markets on Latin American SSFs.},

A comparative analysis of five small-scale Latin American shellfisheries was conducted to identify factors suggesting success and failure. In Chile, Uruguay and Mexico Co-M produced positive effects, including stabilization of landings at low levels, increase in abundance, CPUE, unit prices and revenues per unit of effort, and reduced interannual variability in several fishery indicators, particularly in landings. Co-M was successful because it was mainly bottom-up implemented and accompanied by-catch shares (spatial property rights and community quotas). By contrast, Co-M implementation was unable to prevent the collapse of the Galapagos sea cucumber fishery, as reflected by a decrease in abundance and CPUE. Negative effects were also observed in the Galapagos spiny lobster fishery during Co-M implementation. However, recovery was observed in recent years, reflected in a stabilization of fishing effort and the highest CPUE and economic revenues observed since the beginning of the Co-M implementation phase. The combined effects of market forces, climate variability and a moratorium on fishing effort were critical in fishery recovery. We conclude that Co-M is not a blueprint that can be applied to all shellfisheries to enhance their governability. These social\textendash{}ecological systems need to be managed by jointly addressing problems related to the resources, their marine environment and the people targeting them, accounting for their socioeconomic and cultural contexts.},

Historically, Japanese small-scale fisheries are known for their successful management through fisheries cooperatives and traditional local institutions. Significant change has taken place in the last 20 years, however, with the consolidation of local, port-level FCAs into prefecture level ones. A question is thus raised about the overall quality for governance, i.e. capacity and capability, in such large-scale mergers of local, port-level cooperatives into prefectural ones. In other words, is the fisheries system more or less governable with the new governance arrangement? Consolidating cooperatives may be economically rational; yet doing so disempowers local, small-scale fishers and does not, contrary to stated goals, provide better services to member fishers.},

  abstract = {Suppose you are a physician with a patient whose complaint could arise from multiple diseases. To attain a specific diagnosis, you might ask yourself a series of yes/no questions depending on observed features describing the patient, such as clinical test results and reported symptoms. As some questions rule out certain diagnoses early on, each answer determines which question you ask next. With about a dozen features and extensive medical knowledge, you could create a simple flow chart to connect and order these questions. If you had observations of thousands of features instead, you would probably want to automate. Machine learning methods can learn which questions to ask about these features to classify the entity they describe. Even when we lack prior knowledge, a classifier can tell us which features are most important and how they relate to, or interact with, each other. Identifying interactions with large numbers of features poses a special challenge. In PNAS, Basu et al. (1) address this problem with a new classifier based on the widely used random forest technique. The new method, an iterative random forest algorithm (iRF), increases the robustness of random forest classifiers and provides a valuable new way to identify important feature interactions.

Random forests came into the spotlight in 2001 after their description by Breiman (2). He was largely influenced by previous work, especially the similar ``randomized trees'' method of Amit and Geman (3), as well as Ho's ``random decision forests'' (4). Random forests have since proven useful in many fields due to their high predictive accuracy (5, 6). In biology and medicine, random forests have successfully tackled a range of problems, including predicting drug response in cancer cell lines (7), identifying DNA-binding proteins (8), and localizing cancer to particular tissues from a liquid biopsy (9).

the Mokohinau Islands, were sampled biannually for 4 yr using baited underwater video (BUV). Following the implementation of full marine reserve status at the Poor Knights in October 1998, snapper showed significant increases in abundance and biomass
relative to fished control locations. This was particularly apparent for large snapper ({$>$}270 mm), whose numbers increased rapidly to levels 7.4 times higher in the final survey compared to the initial pre-reserve survey, and total snapper
biomass increased by 818\%. There was no significant increase in the abundance, biomass or size of snapper at the reference locations over this time. There was a strong seasonal trend in snapper abundance, with higher numbers in autumn (March/April)
compared to spring (September/October). The daily batch fecundity was 11 to 18 times higher at the Poor Knights compared to the reference locations. Once fishing ceased in previously partially protected areas, a rapid recovery of snapper ensued,
suggesting that partial fishing regulations are ineffective for protecting targeted species. The speed of increase in snapper density resulted from the immigration of adult fish into the reserve, rather than from within-reserve recruitment.},

An accurate depiction of the state of biodiversity on our planet, combined with identifying the mechanisms driving local biodiversity change, underpins our ability to predict how different societal priorities and actions will influence biodiversity trajectories. Quantitative syntheses provide a fundamental tool by taking information from multiple sources to identify generalisable patterns. However, syntheses, by definition, combine data sources that have fundamentally different purposes, contexts, designs and sources of error and bias; they may thus provide contradictory results, not because of the biological phenomena of interest, but due instead to combining diverse data. While much attention has been focussed on the use of space-for-time substitution methods to estimate the impact of land-use change on terrestrial biodiversity, we show that the most common study designs all face challenges\textemdash{}either conceptual or logistical\textemdash{}that may lead to faulty inferences and ultimately mislead quantitative syntheses.

For management strategy, an equation is derived that characterizes the economic optimal state of exploitation of a modeled stock. A further generalization is derived to account for those species where recruitment to the mature stock occurs over many age-categories. Since the parameters all have phenomenological definitions, they can be estimated from information independent of the model. These parameters can also be estimated by regression of the model to catch and effort data. Test regressions of the general model are made on catch and effort data from three exploited fish stocks: the yellowtail flounder of New England, the Pacific halibut of Area II, and the haddock of Georges Bank; the corresponding R2 values are 0.75, 0.87, and 0.86.

The setting for this paper is a large US emissions cap and trade market - the NOx Budget Trading Program (NBP) - that has greatly reduced NOx emissions since its initiation in 2003. Using rich quasi-experimental variation, we find that the reductions in NOx emissions decreased the number of summer days with high ozone levels by about 25\%. The NBP also led to reductions in expenditures on prescription pharmaceutical expenditures of about 1.9\%. Additionally, the summer mortality rate declined by approximately 0.5\%, indicating that there were about 2,200 fewer premature deaths per summer, mainly among individuals 75 and older. The monetized value of the reductions in pharmaceutical purchases and mortality rates are each roughly \$900 million annually, suggesting that defensive investments are a significant portion of willingness to pay for air quality. Finally, we cautiously conclude that the reductions in ozone are the primary channel for these reductions in defensive investments and mortality rates, which indicates that willingness to pay for ozone reductions is larger than previously understood.},

  abstract = {We evaluate a method for fitting models to time series of population abundances that incorporates both process noise and observation error in a likelihood framework. The method follows the probability logic of the Kalman filter, but whereas the Kalman filter applies to linear, Gaussian systems, we implement the full probability calculations numerically so that any nonlinear, non-Gaussian model can be used. We refer to the method as the ``numerically integrated state-space (NISS) method'' and compare it to two common methods used to analyze nonlinear time series in ecology: least squares with only process noise (LSPN) and least squares with only observation error (LSOE). We compare all three methods by fitting Beverton-Holt and Ricker models to many replicate model-generated time series of length 20 with several parameter choices. For the Ricker model we chose parameters for which the deterministic part of the model produces a stable equilibrium, a two-cycle, or a four-cycle. For each set of parameters we used three process-noise and observation-error scenarios: large standard deviation (0.2) for both, and large for one but small (0.05) for the other. The NISS method had lower estimator bias and variance than the other methods in nearly all cases. The only exceptions were for the Ricker model with stable-equilibrium parameters, in which case the LSPN and LSOE methods has lower bias when noise variances most closely met their assumptions. For the Beverton-Holt model, the NISS method was much less biased and more precise than the other methods. We also evaluated the utility of each method for model selection by fitting simulated data to both models and using information criteria for selection. The NISS and LSOE methods showed a strong bias toward selecting the Ricker over the Beverton-Holt, even when data were generated with the Beverton-Holt. It remains unclear whether the LSPN method is generally superior for model selection or has fortuitously better biases in this particular case. These results suggest that information criteria are best used with caution for nonlinear population models with short time series. Finally we evaluated the convergence of likelihood ratios to theoretical asymptotic distributions. Agreement with asymptotic distributions was very good for stable-point Ricker parameters, less accurate for two-cycle and four-cycle Ricker parameters, and least accurate for the Beverton-Holt model. The numerically integrated state-space method has a number of advantages over least squares methods and offers a useful tool for connecting models and data and ecology.},

To manage marine resources effectively, it is necessary to adapt management to changes in the physical environment. Simple relationships between environmental conditions and fish abundance have long been used in both fisheries and fishery management. In many cases, however, physical, biological, and human variables feed back on each other. For these systems, associations between variables can change as the system evolves in time. This can obscure relationships between population dynamics and environmental variability, undermining our ability to forecast changes in populations tied to physical processes. Here we present a methodology for identifying physical forcing variables based on nonlinear forecasting and show how the method provides a predictive understanding of the influence of physical forcing on Pacific sardine.},

This study documents the recovery of the lobster Palinurus elephas within a large Mediterranean no-take marine reserve (MR) and uses it as a baseline to assess stock status in exploited grounds in the region. Lobster indices of density and biomass within the MR continued to increase after 25years of protection, a period close to the species' lifespan. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) in weight more than doubled from years 10th to 25th without fishing in the reserve while the increase of CPUE in numbers was only 20\%. This faster increase in biomass reflected individual growth and spillover of predominantly smaller lobsters to adjacent grounds. A highly depleted status of exploited populations was inferred from the demographic structure and CPUEs, with fishery:MR ratios and reproductive potential indices below 0.05. In the MR the size-class of maximum egg production increased over time, in contrast to stable sizes classes in fished areas. The contribution of small lobster ({$<$}90mm CL) to overall egg production was only 1.5\% in the MR and 30\% in the fished areas. Mortality estimated from recent size compositions was three to four times higher in fished areas than inside the MR, resulting in a reduction in predicted spawning potential per recruit close to 20\% of the unfished level. This experiment emphasizes the value of long-term no-take areas as reference laboratories for investigating fishing effects.},

  abstract = {The performance of management strategies for a prawn fishery in northern Australia is evaluated using the management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach. The operating model on which the analyses are based includes population dynamics models for four prawn species and five stocks of each species, an effort allocation model and a benthic impacts model. Management is implemented through controls on the fishing effort that targets the two main target species (Penaeus semisulcatus and Penaeus esculentus) and the technical interactions between the two species are also taken into account. The total effort set by management is distributed to regions and grid cells in each region through effort allocation models. The performance measures used in this study cover conservation of the target species, economic returns and the impact of fishing on benthic communities. Two classes of management strategy are evaluated. One class seeks to move stocks towards the target spawning stock size which is a pre-specified fraction of the spawning stock size at which Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) is achieved using a threshold control rule, while the other class selects time-trajectories of future effort to maximize discounted profit. Management strategies that control effort levels to maximize the total profit over the long-term outperform those which aim to move the spawning stock size toward SMSY in terms of most performance measures. For example, even when the target stock size for the MSY-based management strategy is selected to be the same as that which maximizes profits, selecting effort to maximize profits leads to lower variability in catches and profits. This study illustrates how broader ecosystem considerations can be included in MSE analyses without the need for the development and implementation of full ecosystem models and hence provides a ``middle road'' between single-species MSEs and full ecosystem MSEs.},

Many of these fisheries also tend to have a mix of information, with stock assessments available for some species and almost no information on other species. The fleets themselves comprise fishers from small family enterprises to large vertically integrated businesses. The Queensland trawl fishery in Australia is used as a case study for this kind of fishery. It has the added complexity that a large part of the fishery is within a World Heritage Area, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which is managed by an agency of the Australian Commonwealth Government whereas the fishery itself is managed by the Queensland State Government. A stakeholder elicitation process was used to develop social, governance, economic and ecological objectives, and then weight the relative importance of these. An expert group was used to develop different governance strawmen (or management strategies) and these were assessed by a group of industry stakeholders and experts using multi-criteria decision analysis techniques against the different objectives. One strawman clearly provided the best overall set of outcomes given the multiple objectives, but was not optimal in terms of every objective, demonstrating that even the ``best'' strawman may be less than perfect.},

Why the complex nature of integrated ecosystem assessments requires a flexible and adaptive approach. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsu027. This article considers the approach taken by the ICES to integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs) in the context of the wider evolution of IEAs and the science/policy landscape within the ICES region. It looks forward and considers the challenges facing the development of IEAs, specifically those of scoping for objectives, participatory engagement, developing indicators and targets, risk analysis, and creating tools to evaluate management measures for marine anthropogenic activities. It concludes that expectations that the implementation of IEAs will take an ordered, stepwise approach will lead to disappointment and frustration. This is a consequence of the need to operate in an adaptive manner in a complex system. The ecosystem, the science support infrastructure, and the governance systems are all complex. Plus when engaged in a debate about societal objectives, we expect to encounter a complex and changing landscape. As a community, the challenge is to find leverage mechanisms to encourage IEA efforts to provide insights and tools within resources. We will need to innovate and be responsive to the complexity of the ecosystem and governance structures encountered when performing IEA.},

The original ensemble method is Bayesian averaging, but more recent algorithms include error-correcting output coding, Bagging, and boosting. This paper reviews these methods and explains why ensembles can often perform better than any single classifier. Some previous studies comparing ensemble methods are reviewed, and some new experiments are presented to uncover the reasons that Adaboost does not overfit rapidly.},

  abstract = {Protected areas not allowing extractive activities (here called fully protected area) are a spatially explicit conservation management tool commonly used to ensure populations persistence. This is achieved when an adequate fraction of a species' population spends most of its time within the boundaries of the protected area. Within a marine context, home ranges represent a tractable metric to provide guidance and evaluation of fully protected areas. We compiled peer-reviewed literature specific to the home ranges of finfishes and invertebrates of ecological and/or commercial importance in the Mediterranean Sea, and related this to the size of 184 Mediterranean fully protected areas. We also investigated the influence of fully protected areas size on fish density in contrast to fished areas with respect to home ranges. Home range estimations were available for 11 species (10 fishes and 1 lobster). The European spiny lobster Palinurus elephas had the smallest home range (0.0039 {$\pm$} 0.0014 km2; mean {$\pm$} 1 SE), while the painted comber Serranus scriba (1.1075 {$\pm$} 0.2040 km2) had the largest. Approximately 25\% of Mediterranean fully protected areas are larger than 2 times the size of the largest home range recorded. Fish densities were significantly higher when fully protected areas were larger than the home range, while no change in density occurred when home ranges were larger than fully protected areas. These results display a direct link between the effectiveness of fully protected areas and species' home range, suggesting that fully protected areas of at least 3.6 km2 may increase the density of local populations of these coastal marine species.},

  abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), if well designed and managed, can produce conservation benefits to fish assemblages within no-take zones and fishery benefits in neighboring areas through `spillover'. However, although plenty of studies have provided evidence of the benefits produced within MPA boundaries, overall benefits to local fisheries, especially via spillover, seem to be still unclear. Because of the lost fishing grounds following an MPA establishment, local fishermen usually oppose MPAs. There is, therefore, the urgent need for a better understanding of the mechanism(s) through which MPAs can export fishable fish biomass towards adjacent fished areas, a process that could counterbalance the loss of fishing grounds. Here we review the literature on spillover for refining the terminology, detailing the underlying mechanisms and identifying both the existing and needed methodological approaches to measure spillover. Operationally, two types of spillover should be considered: ecological spillover (i.e. the net export of juvenile, subadult and adult biomass from MPAs outwards driven by density-dependent processes) and the fishery spillover (i.e. the proportion of this biomass that can be fished, taking into account regulations and accessibility). Underwater visual census and tagging/tracking may allow getting evidence of ecological spillover, while experimental catch data are essential to assess and monitor fishery spillover, which is the main component of MPAs that can provide direct benefit to local fisheries.},

While engineering solutions can now safely produce recycled and desalinated water from non-potable sources at a relatively low cost, the general public is sceptical about adopting these alternative water sources. Social scientists, policy makers and technical experts need to better understand what is causing this lack of acceptance by the general population and how acceptance levels for recycled and desalinated water can be increased. This study is the first to conduct a comparative analysis of knowledge, perceptions, and acceptability, and determine segments of residents who are more open-minded than the general population toward the use of recycled and desalinated water. The Australian population once perceived desalinated water as environmentally unfriendly, and recycled water as a public health hazard. The general level of knowledge about these two concepts as potential water sources has historically been low. After nearly five years of serious drought, accompanied by severe water restrictions across most of the country, and subsequent media attention on solutions to water scarcity, Australians now show more acceptance of desalinated water for close-to-body uses, and less resistance to recycled water for garden watering and cleaning uses. The types of people likely to be strong accepters of the two alternative water sources are distinctly different groups, and can be reached through different media mixes. This finding has significant implications for policy makers and water practitioners.},

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In ``The Future of Data Analysis,'' he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or ``data analysis.'' Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name ``data science'' for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of ``data science'' programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M ``Data Science Initiative'' that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as ``cultural appropriation.'' This article reviews some ingredients of the current ``data science moment,'' including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for ``scaling up'' to ``big data.'' This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere ``scaling up,'' but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are ``learning from data,'' and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today's data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals.

However, given the complexity and diversity of the ecosystem, research on how regimes vary spatially and temporally is needed. Reef regimes are most often characterised by their benthic components; however, complex dynamics are associated with losses and gains in both fish and benthic assemblages. To capture this complexity, we synthesised 3,345 surveys from Hawai`i to define reef regimes in terms of both fish and benthic assemblages. Model-based clustering revealed five distinct regimes that varied ecologically, and were spatially heterogeneous by island, depth and exposure. We identified a regime characteristic of a degraded state with low coral cover and fish biomass, one that had low coral but high fish biomass, as well as three other regimes that varied significantly in their ecology but were previously considered a single coral dominated regime. Analyses of time series data reflected complex system dynamics, with multiple transitions among regimes that were a function of both local and global stressors. Coupling fish and benthic communities into reef regimes to capture complex dynamics holds promise for monitoring reef change and guiding ecosystem-based management of coral reefs.},

  abstract = {With an average yield of 70 000 Mt from 1999 to 2006, market squid (Doryteuthis opalescens) represents one of the most commercially valuable and biologically productive populations off California. An egg escapement model was developed for evaluating the population's reproductive response to varying levels of fishing pressure and, potentially, for aiding management of the fishery. The model is founded on eggs-per-recruit theory, assuming catch fecundity is related to daily-based fishing mortality (F), i.e. analysis generated estimates of proportional egg escapement, S(F), as a function of F per quarter from 1999 to 2006 in three spawning grounds off northern and southern California. Fishing pressure was generally high, with mean derived F ranging from 0.20 to 6 per day. Mean estimated S(F) ranged from 0.08 to 0.75, but in most quarters was higher than 0.30. The classical model was extended for estimating absolute abundance of the resource based on F. Market squid were more abundant in southern California, where mean spawning stock peaked at 1.50 \texttimes{} 109 females, \textasciitilde{}108 000 and 130 000 Mt in autumn 2000 and winter 2005 respectively. Although time demanding, this per-recruit analysis represents an effective approach for monitoring reproductive outputs and for aiding stock status determinations of harvested market squid.},

The method constructs a set of weights such that covariates and pre-treatment outcomes of the treated unit are approximately matched by a weighted average of control units. The weights are restricted to be nonnegative and sum to one, which allows the procedure to obtain the weights even when the number of lagged outcomes is modest relative to the number of control units, a setting that is not uncommon in applications. In the current paper we propose a more general class of synthetic control estimators that allows researchers to relax some of the restrictions in the ADH method. We allow the weights to be negative, do not necessarily restrict the sum of the weights, and allow for a permanent additive difference between the treated unit and the controls, similar to difference-in-difference procedures. The weights directly minimize the distance between the lagged outcomes for the treated and the control units, using regularization methods to deal with a potentially large number of possible control units.},

  abstract = {During the past 10 years, the evolution of marine spatial planning (MSP) and ocean zoning has become a crucial step in making ecosystem-based, sea use management a reality. The idea was initially stimulated by international and national interest in developing marine protected areas, e.g., the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. More recent attention has been placed on managing the multiple use of marine space, especially in areas where conflicts among users and the environment are already clear, e.g., in the North Sea. Even more recent concern has focused on the need to conserve nature, especially ecologically and biologically sensitive areas, in the context of multi-use planning of ocean space. Despite academic discussions and the fact that some countries already have started implementation, the scope of MSP has not been clearly defined. Terms such as integrated management, marine spatial management, and ocean zoning are all used inconsistently. This is one of the reasons why its importance is not more seriously reflected at the levels of policy and decision-making in most countries. This article attempts to deal with this problem. It describes why MSP is an essential step to achieve ecosystem-based sea use management, how it can be defined and what its core objectives are. The article concludes with an analysis of the use and achievements of MSP worldwide, with particular focus on new approaches in Europe.},

  abstract = {The majority of the world's fisheries, by number, are data-poor/limited, and there is a growing body of literature pertaining to approaches to estimate data-limited stock status. There are at least two drivers for assessing the status of data-limited fisheries. The first is to try to understand and report on the global or regional status of fisheries across many stocks. The second is to attempt to assess individual data-limited stocks, for status reporting and/or guiding management decisions. These drivers have led to attempts to find simple, generic, low-cost solutions, including the broad application of generically parameterised models, and the blanket application of a single, or limited number of possible, analytical approach(es). It is unclear that generic methods function as intended, especially when taken out of their original design context or used without care. If the intention is to resolve individual stock status for the purposes of management, there is concern with the indiscriminate application of a single method to a suite of stocks irrespective of the particular circumstances of each. We examine why caution needs to be exercised, and provide guidance on the appropriate application of data-limited assessment methods (DLMs). We recommend: (a) obtaining better data, (b) using care in acknowledging and interpreting uncertainties in the results of DLMs, (c) embedding DLMs in harvest strategies that are robust to the higher levels of uncertainty in the output of DLMs by including precautionary management measures or buffers and (d) selecting and applying DLMs appropriate to specific species' and fisheries' data and context.},

  abstract = {Increasing use of spatial management tools in fisheries requires an understanding of fleet response, and in particular to where displaced fishing effort is likely to move. We develop a state-dependent decision-making model to address the spatial allocation of effort in an Australian tuna longline fishery. We assume that fishers have an economic objective in deciding where to fish, but that decisions in any period are also influenced by the remaining quota held at the time of the decision. Key features of the model include endogenous price dynamics, a moving stock and a competitive pool of different vessel types operating from different port locations. We utilize this model to illustrate fleet responses to marine reserves and limits on fishing effort. The results illustrate that the model framework provides advantages over statistically based models in that decisions made in response to the imposition of a reserve are not consistent with a proportional reallocation of effort. Rather, the stochastic dynamic model yielded an overall profit level of {$\sim$}4\% higher relative to scenarios with no reserve. Incorporating the opportunity cost of a quota into the model resulted in an optimal utilization of effort, in which effort was concentrated in time periods and locations yielding maximized profit. Under a low level of effort relative to the season length, the model indicated an overall profit level 43\% greater than the highest obtained when the same level of effort was applied solely within any given quarter of the season.},

  abstract = {Fishery managers are faced with the challenge of maintaining sustainable fisheries at the lowest possible cost while conforming to international and national obligations. Given that fisheries range from low to high value, there is a real need to understand how to trade ecological and economic risks, and the various costs associated with their management, against the benefits from catch. Key to this is an understanding of (a) the costs corresponding to a given level of acceptable risk, or conversely, (b) the change in risk given a change in cost investment. This paper first defines biological, economic and ecosystem risk at a whole-of-fishery level, and then develops a simple model to quantify the trade-offs between risk, cost and catch. Using as case studies Australia's federally managed fisheries that range from data-rich to data-poor, risk was quantified for target species in terms of both their limit and target reference points (defined as ``biological risk'' and ``economic risk'', respectively), and for ecosystems in terms of overall ecological impact (defined as ``ecosystem risk''). A statistical linear model was used to quantify the risk\textendash{}cost\textendash{}catch frontier for each of the three forms of risk. The most parsimonious models were statistically significant for each. However, the management and research costs were mostly positively correlated with risk, indicating that these tended to be reactive to risk, as opposed to risk decreasing in response to increased costs. The only model where this was not the case was for the ecosystem risk, which is probably because these risks have only recently been assessed and the management response to these risks across all the fisheries has so far been limited. For target species risks, it was not possible to develop a model for proactive use. However, the method itself has merit and, if the costs were defined to a greater level of resolution, and/or a time-dynamic modelling approach considered, these issues could potentially be addressed.},

  abstract = {There has been extensive literature discussion regarding data-poor assessments, but considerably less on harvest strategies for data-poor fisheries. There is also a large body of work around harvest strategy development for data-rich fisheries. However, there has been little discussion or specific guidance regarding the process of developing and implementing formal harvest strategies for data-poor fisheries. We outline such a process, illustrated using case studies of data-poor Australian Commonwealth fisheries. The process comprises: (1) compile and review available information; (2) identify possibly indicators; (3) identify reference points for key indicators; (4) select an appropriate harvest strategy and decision rules; (5) if possible, formally evaluate whether the harvest strategy options are likely to achieve the management objectives; and (6) implementation. While this approach is similar to that for data-rich cases, there is less statistical or estimation detail within each step. Even with minimal capacity, the guidelines outlined here, backed by even the simplest form of management strategy evaluation, provide an approach that should enable harvest strategies to be proposed and associated monitoring to be implemented. Monitoring requirements may be explicitly built into harvest strategies via trigger reference points and control rules related to data-collection. While prior formal evaluation provides the best basis for testing the efficacy of a harvest strategy, there remains disparity between the corresponding required capacity and what many agencies and institutions worldwide are capable of providing. Thus, the extent to which harvest strategies may be effectively evaluated and implemented remains an unresolved challenge for data-poor fisheries, but one whose resolution is predicated, at least in the first instance, on adequate monitoring.},

A principal component analysis was applied to the expanded Australian Commonwealth 8-tier system for fishery assessment and management to determine whether it adequately delineates across stocks according to data availability and quality. The original Australian tiers comprised four levels that were defined primarily according to the available stock assessment options, given the data availability and quality. We asked fishery experts to score information quality for each of the main Australian Commonwealth species and/or fisheries. Multivariate analysis indicated that the eight tiers delineated between the extreme tier levels on the first principal component, although there was overlap for intermediate tiers. More generally, it is important that the aim of tier systems and the basis for tier delineations are explicitly defined given the increasing association of tiers with trade-offs between overfishing risk, management cost and catch.},

The present paper illustrates how the concepts of stochastic co-viability, which accounts for dynamic complexities, uncertainties, risk and sustainability constraints, can be useful for the implementation of EBFM. In the present case, this concept is used to identify fishing strategies that satisfy both ecological conservation and economic sustainability in a multi-species, multi-fleet context. Economic Viability Analysis (EVA) and the broader Co-Viability Analysis (CVA), are proposed to expand the usual Population Viability Analysis (PVA) and precautionary approach. An illustration is proposed, using data on the fisheries of Bay of Biscay (France) exploiting the stocks of nephrops and hake. Stochastic simulations show how CVA can guarantee both ecological (stock) and economic (profit) sustainability. Using 2008 as a baseline, the model is used to identify fishing efforts that ensure such co-viability.},

  abstract = {Networks from a wide range of physical, biological, and social systems have been recently described as ``small-world'' and ``scale-free.'' However, studies disagree whether ecological networks called food webs possess the characteristic path lengths, clustering coefficients, and degree distributions required for membership in these classes of networks. Our analysis suggests that the disagreements are based on selective use of relatively few food webs, as well as analytical decisions that obscure important variability in the data. We analyze a broad range of 16 high-quality food webs, with 25\textendash{}172 nodes, from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Food webs generally have much higher complexity, measured as connectance (the fraction of all possible links that are realized in a network), and much smaller size than other networks studied, which have important implications for network topology. Our results resolve prior conflicts by demonstrating that although some food webs have small-world and scale-free structure, most do not if they exceed a relatively low level of connectance. Although food-web degree distributions do not display a universal functional form, observed distributions are systematically related to network connectance and size. Also, although food webs often lack small-world structure because of low clustering, we identify a continuum of real-world networks including food webs whose ratios of observed to random clustering coefficients increase as a power\textendash{}law function of network size over 7 orders of magnitude. Although food webs are generally not small-world, scale-free networks, food-web topology is consistent with patterns found within those classes of networks.},

The approach allows us to undertake both an ex post evaluation of short-term impacts of ITQs and an ex ante evaluation of longer term impacts. With respect to short-term impacts, the results suggest that larger vessels have benefited the most from the introduction of ITQs, but that all vessels have enjoyed increases in the prices received for those fish species that are included in the quota program. With respect to longer-term impacts, the transferability provisions of the ITQ program have encouraged exit and more efficient operations to prevail.},

(A difficulty with the Kyoto Protocol is that it does not appear to lay the groundwork for a self-enforcing treaty). A self-enforcing treaty can be modeled as a Nash equilibrium of a suitably defined dynamic game among a large number of sovereign countries of diverse sizes and economic capabilities. We study such a game and characterize its equilibria (typically there are many) and the global-Pareto-optimal solutions. We identify one of the equilibria, which we call ``business as usual,'' with the current situation. The multiplicity of equilibria provides an opportunity to move from the inefficient business-as-usual equilibrium to one or more equilibria that are Pareto-superior. Using a calibrated model with 184 countries, we give numerical illustrations of business-as-usual and global-Pareto-optimal trajectories and estimate the potential welfare gains from a self-enforcing treaty.},

  abstract = {Over the past decades, atoll islands exhibited no widespread sign of physical destabilization in the face of sea-level rise. A reanalysis of available data, which cover 30 Pacific and Indian Ocean atolls including 709 islands, reveals that no atoll lost land area and that 88.6\% of islands were either stable or increased in area, while only 11.4\% contracted. Atoll islands affected by rapid sea-level rise did not show a distinct behavior compared to islands on other atolls. Island behavior correlated with island size, and no island larger than 10 ha decreased in size. This threshold could be used to define the minimum island size required for human occupancy and to assess atoll countries and territories' vulnerability to climate change. Beyond emphasizing the major role of climate drivers in causing substantial changes in the configuration of islands, this reanalysis of available data indicates that these drivers explain subregional variations in atoll behavior and within-atoll variations in island and shoreline (lagoon vs. ocean) behavior, following atoll-specific patterns. Increasing human disturbances, especially land reclamation and human structure construction, operated on atoll-to-shoreline spatial scales, explaining marked within-atoll variations in island and shoreline behavior. Collectively, these findings highlight the heterogeneity of atoll situations. Further research needs include addressing geographical gaps (Indian Ocean, Caribbean, north-western Pacific atolls), using standardized protocols to allow comparative analyses of island and shoreline behavior across ocean regions, investigating the role of ecological drivers, and promoting interdisciplinary approaches. Such efforts would assist in anticipating potential future changes in the contributions and interactions of key drivers.

  abstract = {Visitor spending in the recreational razor clam fishery positively impacts the coastal economies of Grays Harbor and Pacific counties in Washington State. Since 1991 the fishery has frequently closed due to harmful algal blooms (HABs). These events reduce or eliminate recreational clam-related visitor spending. We develop an economic impact model, based on recreationists' spending, to estimate the economic impacts of these closures. To estimate visitor expenditure patterns, questionnaires were distributed in April of 2008 to an on-site sample of clammers at four beaches on Washington's Pacific coast: Mocrocks, Copalis, Twin Harbors, and Long Beach. Based upon responses from 240 parties, the average expenditure per party ranged from \$268.77 at Mocrocks beach to \$412.67 at Long Beach. Overall expenditures for the 2007\textendash{}2008 season were estimated at \$24.4 million. A regional input\textendash{}output model was used to estimate that the fishery had the local economic impact of supporting 404 full-time equivalent jobs and \$12.6 million in labor income. To estimate negative impacts of HAB closures, expected visitor expenditures are adjusted to account for visitors' stated intentions when razor clamming is unavailable. For a full year closure of all four beaches, the estimated negative economic impact is a loss of support from the razor clam fishery impacting 339 full-time equivalent jobs and \$10.6 million of labor income in the two counties. Further, impacts were calculated for beach closures ranging from a single (2\textendash{}5 days) season opening to a full year, for individual beaches and combinations of beaches. As expected, the closing of a single opening at one beach had the smallest economic impacts, while whole season closures at multiple beaches had the largest impact.},

In the Eastern Pacific, marine turtles were exploited for millennia before systematic monitoring began {$<$}50~years ago. Using ethnographic and historical data, we generated a detailed reconstruction of the East Pacific green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) fishery in Mexico's Baja California peninsula from 1700 to 1990. Sea turtles from the region's important feeding areas were a staple food source from the earliest phases of human occupation, dating back at least 12,000~years. In contrast with regions such as the Caribbean, small human populations and limited market access resulted in apparently sustainable turtle harvests until the second half of the 20th century. We found that the estimated annual catches between 1960 and 1980 exceeded the estimated annual catches of the previous 250~years by an order of magnitude, leading to the collapse of the fishery and the depletion of the green turtle population. A total ban on sea turtle captures in 1990, comprehensive nesting beach protection, and significant conservation efforts resulted in increases in breeding females on nesting beaches and catch rates in scientific monitoring on main feeding grounds since the early 2000s. This provides a positive outlook for this once-depleted population segment. Although further research is needed to evaluate current conservation status, we have identified a date, between 1950 and 1960, which can serve as a reliable temporal reference for future evaluations of historical baseline abundance in this region.},

Even with a high level of interspersion between conservation, tourism and fishing management zones, major differences in densities of economically important species were evident between zone types prior to enforcement of fishing restrictions. Densities of the most valuable fishery resource, sea cucumbers, were three times higher in zones that remained open to fishing compared to `no-take' conservation zones, and densities of sharks were five times higher in tourism zones than fishing or conservation zones. These results highlight bias in the socio-political processes that can accompany selection of marine protected areas, where fishers attempt to minimize perceived impacts on their livelihood by locating large protected zones in resource-poor areas, and tourism operators and sport divers argue for protection of areas containing atypically-interesting features. Bias in the location of fully protected zones can seriously confound `control-impact' field investigations when data prior to prohibitions on fishing are lacking, including meta-analyses, which are dominated by such potentially systematically biased studies.},

To be productive, however, this framework must be combined with property rights institutions that clearly state management objectives, create long-run time-horizons among harvesters, internalize spillovers caused by ecological and technological jointness, and reduce uncertainty through research and adaptive management. Although the cost of reducing scientific uncertainty about ecological interactions may limit the portfolio approach to intensive management of relatively few species, its scope can be broadened to integrate tradeoffs among more types of marine resources, such as nature preserves and oil and gas deposits.},

First, we quantified lunar variation in settlement on standardized artificial substrates to determine whether or not intra- and inter-annual variability in recruitment could be adequately described by measuring influx of postlarvae during the first quarter of each new moon, as suggested by previous studies. Next, we compared settlement data obtained from artificial surface substrates to concentrations of postlarvae in the water column and benthic settlement. Long-term (6 yr) spatiotemporal variation in postlarval settlement was then quantified at 8 sites spanning a longitudinal and onshore distance of 43 km and 11 km, respectively. Lastly, we examined the relationship between postlarval settlement and environmental variables with time-series analyses. The key findings were that: (1) significant lunar (first quarter of lunar phase) and seasonal (fall peak) periodicities in settlement were consistent across sites; (2) postlarval settlement varied more across sites (\textasciitilde{}600\%) than between years at a single site (\textasciitilde{}50\%), and inter-site differences were consistent across time (i.e. some sites always had higher settlement than others); (3) settlement was correlated with along-shore winds blowing towards the southeast, but not with cross-shelf winds or water temperature; (4) floating, 'Witham-type' artificial settlement substrates yielded an accurate index of postlarval concentration and flux past a given point; and (5) floating substrates were a relatively poor indicator of benthic settlement, though the relationship between surface and benthic settlement may depend upon benthic habitat availability and postlarval supply. These results indicate that artificial settlement substrates provide a reliable index of postlarval supply to inshore nursery habitats, and that a combination of stochastic and deterministic forces influence recruitment over various scales of time and space.},

Estimates of Z were unreasonably biased when exploitable life spans were 50\% or less of the biological life span of the species considered in the analyses. Biases were larger at lower levels of fishing mortality rates. We developed a new method from a truncated equation for average fish length. It considers length at first capture and the maximum retainable length actually observed in the fishery catch. The method has no explicit solution for Z, so we used numerical methods to provide its solution. The new estimator has zero bias at equilibrium. We determined variance of the new Z-estimator by bootstrap techniques.},

  abstract = {Stock assessments utilize many parameters which are known to contain uncertainty about the point estimate. This uncertainty can arise from many sources including natural variability, estimation procedures, statistical fitting, and lack of knowledge regarding the parameter. The uncertainty in parameter estimates can be incorporated in the stock assessment to produce a variable result under a given management scheme. This variability provides flexibility to managers, but also has implications for the stock depending upon where in the range of possibilities the managers decide.

This study uses the Spanish mackerel, Scomberomorus maculatus, fishery in the US Gulf of Mexico as a case study of incorporating uncertainty in stock assessment. Spanish mackerel stock assessments perform calibrated virtual population analysis followed by prediction of recruitment and application of a non-equilibrium F\%SPR to arrive at a range of allowable biological catches (ABC). A quota called the total allowable catch is then chosen by managers from the range of ABCs. In this paper we present methods to incorporate trends in the tuning indices of virtual population analysis and uncertainty in the shrimp trawl bycatch of Spanish mackerel, growth parameters, and natural mortality. We examine the effects of each source of uncertainty independently and then examine interaction effects among the sources. We use a 3-D graphical presentation of the ABCs for each scenario which allows comparison of uncertainty among and within different sets of parameters. The risk implications of choosing a given total allowable catch from the ABCs are also demonstrated both for the fishing industry and the fish stock.},

We randomly offered fishers in Indonesia a bonus for catching certain species of fish above certain sizes. We observe clear differences in catch as a result. Instead of inducing fishers to catch more fish of every size, the premium caused a shift in the size distribution of catch towards larger fish. The price premium worked well for a large-sized species but had no effect on the catch of a small-sized species. In particular, we find that the length of Aprion virescens increased by 15\% and the average length of all fish caught increased by 8\% when fishers were offered the price premium. It does not appear that fishers respond to the premium by high-grading their catch, which would only affect supply and not extraction. The changes appear to be driven by fishers going to different locations and fishing at different depths. Our experiment is the first ever proof-of-concept of Payment for Ecosystem Services in a developing country fishery. Our results also suggest that prices can alter length\textendash{}frequency distributions, confirming a possible source of bias in length-based stock assessment models.},

Therefore, the extinction of a species can reverberate through the network and cause other (possibly distantly connected) species to go extinct as well. The study of these secondary extinctions is a fertile area of research in ecological network theory.

* However, to facilitate practical applications, several improvements to the current analytical approaches are needed. In particular, we need to consider that (i) species have different `a priori' probabilities of extinction, (ii) disturbances can simultaneously affect several species, and (iii) extinction risk of consumers likely grows with resource loss. All these points can be included in dynamical models, which are, however, difficult to parameterize.

* Here we advance the study of secondary extinctions with Bayesian networks. We show how this approach can account for different extinction responses using binary \textendash{} where each resource has the same importance \textendash{} and quantitative data \textendash{} where resources are weighted by their importance. We simulate ecological networks using a popular dynamical model (the Allometric Trophic Network model) and use it to test our method.

* We find that the Bayesian network model captures the majority of the secondary extinctions produced by the dynamical model and that consumers' responses to species loss are best modelled using a nonlinear sigmoid function. We also show that an approach based exclusively on food web structure loses power when species at higher trophic levels are preferentially lost. Because the loss of apex predators is unfortunately widespread, the results highlight a serious limitation of studies on network robustness.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that water masses which compose the poleward Peru-Chile Undercurrent (PCUC) and the equatorward Peru Coastal Current are influenced by the mean state and variability of the Equatorial Under Current (EUC) and of the South Equatorial Current. Several modeling studies emphasized that EUC intensity is strongly affected by the topographic barrier formed by the Galapagos Islands (GI) and the spatial resolution of the model, which can reduce the eastward flow and the associated cold bias usually present in the cold tongue in the majority of CGCMs. Consequently, the archipelago appears to be a key element connecting the Equatorial Pacific and the Humboldt Current System. A ROMS (Regional Oceanic Model System) model configuration was designed to address the role of the small scale topography of the GI on the dynamics of the area. The employed methodology was quite simple: 2 climatological simulations (15 years after spin ups) were run, one including the archipelago with a 1/6 \textdegree{} resolution, the other one excluding all bathymetric features above 3000m depth in the vicinity of GI. The main investigated questions are how the model spatial fine resolution impacts the Eastern Pacific mean state, seasonal variability, meso-scale dynamics in the region and the EUC/PCUC pathways, which are studied using Lagrangian diagnostics. The influence of these islands on the propagation of equatorial and coastally trapped Kelvin waves, and on the reflection of Rossby waves is also diagnosed, because of the role of these waves on the surface and sub-surface water properties off South America coast. The possible rectification of Tropical eastern Pacific mean state through changes in waves propagation features, namely changes in vertical stratification, is also investigated. Results will be confronted to TAO mooring data (95 \textdegree{} W, just west of GI) and to satellite altimetry in order to validate our modeling procedure.},

A consequence of changing from input controls to output-based (catch) management is that the control of the regulating authority tends to be reduced, which may affect the outcomes for ecosystem management. This study reviewed the use of input controls across six fishing methods in 18 ITQ fisheries, which have been independently accredited as ecologically sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (12 fisheries) or under Australian environmental legislation for Wildlife Trade Operation (six fisheries). Input controls were retained across a range of ITQ fisheries, with non-selective fisheries such as trawl, gillnet and line employing more input controls than selective fisheries such as purse-seine, pot/trap and dredge. Further case-studies confirmed the widespread and recent use of input controls (spatial and temporal closures) with the aim of managing ecosystem impacts of fishing. The retention of input controls, particularly closures affects the security (quality of title) characteristic of the fishing use right and the theoretical ability of fishers to manage their right for their future benefit. The security characteristic is weakened by closures through loss of access, which undermines industry trust and incentive for long-term decision making. By reducing the security of ITQs, individual fisher incentives and behaviour may separate from societal objectives for sustainability, which was one of the foremost reasons for introducing ITQ management.},

  abstract = {Successful individual transferable quota (ITQ) management requires a binding (constraining) total allowable catch (TAC). A non-binding TAC may result in a shift back towards open access conditions, where fishers increasingly compete (`race') to catch their share of the total harvest. This process was examined by comparing fishing fleet behaviour and profitability in the Tasmanian southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) fishery (TSRLF), Australia. Between 2008 and 2010, the TSRLF had a non-binding TAC and effectively reverted to a regulated, limited-entry fishery. Fishers' uncertainty about future profitability and their ability to take their allocated catch weakened the security characteristic of the ITQ allocation. The low quota lease price contributed to an increase in fleet capacity, while the more limited reduction in quota asset value proved an investment barrier, hindering the autonomous adjustment of quota towards the most efficient fishers. In the TSRLF, catch rates vary more than beach price and are therefore more important for determining daily revenue (i.e., price x catch rate) than market price. Consequently, fishers concentrated effort during times of higher catch rates rather than high market demand. This increased rent dissipation as fishers engaged in competitive race to fish to be the first to exploit the stock and obtain higher catch rates. The history of this fishery emphasizes the need for a constraining TAC in all ITQ fisheries, not only for stock management, but also to manage the security of the ITQ allocation and prevent unanticipated and undesirable changes in fisher behaviour and fishery profitability.},

  abstract = {Fisheries managers often face the challenge of addressing multiple, conflicting objectives. Historically, the focus has been on biological objectives but there has been an increasing appreciation of the importance of economic and social objectives. A desire to address economic objectives has partly driven the increasing use of individual transferable quotas (ITQs). However, ITQs are insufficient to achieve the economic objectives as a suite of other decisions and regulations affect outcomes. Assignment problems are common in ITQ fisheries and can reduce economic yield. They occur through misallocation of fishing effort, particularly when there is spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the stock, leading to inefficient timing of supply and overexploitation and congestion in parts of the fishing grounds. Clubs in the form of fishing cooperatives have the capacity to resolve these problems through coordinating the fishing effort of their members. The likelihood of a single fishing cooperative forming and uniting to resolve assignment problems however, may be diminished under ITQ management due to the increasing heterogeneity in business structures, incentives and motivations among fishers generated by market-based mechanisms. This heterogeneity can also have ramifications for fishers trying to reach an agreed industry position that can be presented to government when negotiating on management changes that deal with assignment problems. In this situation, the absence of an agreed industry position should not act as an impediment to government in prioritising, articulating and taking the lead in implementing measures that reduce assignment problems and concurrently meet their overarching economic objectives.},

Overfishing is exacerbated in developing countries where management systems lack capacity to control large numbers of fishers influenced by poverty. In contrast, the tropical sea cucumber fishery in Australia's World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) is operating in a developed high-income country with relatively few licensed fishers to manage. The development of this fishery is reviewed here in a meta-analysis of catches from 1991 to 2011. The fishery expanded to replace high-value teatfish species (Holothuria whitmaei and H.~fuscogilva), fished heavily in initial stages of the fishery, with newly commercialized medium-value species such as burying blackfish (Actinopyga spinea) and curryfish (Stichopus herrmanni). These two species now constitute 80\% of total catch. The annual average catch of burying blackfish was 208~tonnes years 2004\textendash{}11 and curryfish catches increased rapidly at an average annual pace of 200\% from 2007\textendash{}11. This serial harvest pattern occurred in the absence of baseline studies and without independent resource assessments, information required to inform relevant harvest predictions and to determine fishery impacts. This situation does not support ecologically relevant and adaptive decision-making in management and the unfolding catch patterns in the GBRMP follow those in low-income developing countries. The missing knowledge and lack of data serve as arguments to support precautionary reductions in harvests and extending fallow periods in fishing zones.},

We analysed 40~years of trade statistics of a SSF product that enter international markets (sea cucumber) from 14 Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICT) against response variables to test predictors of fishery production: (i) scale, (ii) productivity and (iii) socio-economics. Combined production in PICT peaked over 20~years ago, driven by exploitation trends in Melanesia that accounted for 90\% of all production since 1971. The size of island fisheries (as measured by total exports), and the duration and magnitude of fishery booms were most influenced by ungovernable environmental variables, in particular land area. The large and high islands of Melanesia sustained larger booms over longer periods than atoll nations. We hypothesize that land area is a proxy for land-based nutrient availability and habitat diversity, and therefore the productivity of the shallow water areas where SSF are operating. PICT need to tailor management based on the intrinsic productivity of shallow inshore habitats: harvests from atoll nations will need to be smaller per unit area than at the high islands. Particularly countries with low productivity fisheries must consider the crucial economic ``safety nets'' that export SSF make up for dispersed island populations and incorporate them into broader development and island resilience strategies.},

Here, we offer a pathway that can unite fishers, scientists, resource managers and conservationists towards a single vision for some areas of the ocean where small investments in management can offer disproportionately large benefits to fisheries and biodiversity conservation. Specifically, we provide a series of evidenced-based arguments that support an urgent need to recognize fish spawning aggregations (FSAs) as a focal point for fisheries management and conservation on a global scale, with a particular emphasis placed on the protection of multispecies FSA sites. We illustrate that these sites serve as productivity hotspots \textendash{} small areas of the ocean that are dictated by the interactions between physical forces and geomorphology, attract multiple species to reproduce in large numbers and support food web dynamics, ecosystem health and robust fisheries. FSAs are comparable in vulnerability, importance and magnificence to breeding aggregations of seabirds, sea turtles and whales yet they receive insufficient attention and are declining worldwide. Numerous case-studies confirm that protected aggregations do recover to benefit fisheries through increases in fish biomass, catch rates and larval recruitment at fished sites. The small size and spatio-temporal predictability of FSAs allow monitoring, assessment and enforcement to be scaled down while benefits of protection scale up to entire populations. Fishers intuitively understand the linkages between protecting FSAs and healthy fisheries and thus tend to support their protection.},

Our assessment shows that five years post-implementation, net benefits to the nation have doubled, and indicators of productivity and profitability have increased. The fleet that targets Pacific whiting has seen the largest gains, due in part to increases in total allowable catch and the elimination of the race-to-fish. However, increased revenues have not been realized to the degree that was expected for harvesters targeting non-whiting groundfish, partly due to lower than predicted consolidation and relatively low quota utilization. Economic outcomes indicate that tradeoffs exist between certain objectives of the program, specifically between achieving full utilization and flexibility for harvesters.

An alternative to this view, that declining mean trophic levels indicate the serial addition of low-trophic-level fisheries (``fishing through the food web''), may be equally severe because it ultimately leads to conflicting demands for ecosystem services. By analyzing trends in fishery landings in 48 large marine ecosystems worldwide, we find that fishing down the food web was pervasive (present in 30 ecosystems) but that the sequential addition mechanism was by far the most common one underlying declines in the mean trophic level of landings. Specifically, only 9 ecosystems showed declining catches of upper-trophic-level species, compared with 21 ecosystems that exhibited either no significant change (n = 6) or significant increases (n = 15) in upper-trophic-level catches when fishing down the food web was occurring. Only in the North Atlantic were ecosystems regularly subjected to sequential collapse and replacement of fisheries. We suggest that efforts to promote sustainable use of marine resources will benefit from a fuller consideration of all processes giving rise to fishing down the food web.},

  abstract = {A growing push to implement catch share fishery programs is based partly on the recognition that they may provide stronger incentives for ecological stewardship than conventional fisheries management. Using data on population status, quota compliance, discard rates, use of habitat-damaging gear, and landings for 15 catch share programs in North America, I tested the hypothesis that catch share systems lead to improved ecological stewardship and status of exploited populations. Impacts of catch share programs were measured through comparisons of fisheries with catch shares to fisheries without catch shares or by comparing fisheries before and after catch shares were implemented. The average levels of most indicators were unaffected by catch share implementation: only discard rate, which declined significantly in catch share fisheries, showed a significant response. However, catch share fisheries were distinguished by markedly reduced interannual variability in all indicators, being statistically significant for exploitation rate, landings, discard rate, and the ratio of catch to catch quotas. These impacts of catch shares were common between nations and ocean basins and were independent of the number of years that catch share programs had been in place. These findings suggest that for the indicators examined, the primary effect of catch shares was greater consistency over time. This enhanced consistency could be beneficial to fishery systems and might also be an indication of more effective management.},

  abstract = {Forage fish support the largest fisheries in the world but also play key roles in marine food webs by transferring energy from plankton to upper trophic-level predators, such as large fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. Fishing can, thereby, have far reaching consequences on marine food webs unless safeguards are in place to avoid depleting forage fish to dangerously low levels, where dependent predators are most vulnerable. However, disentangling the contributions of fishing vs. natural processes on population dynamics has been difficult because of the sensitivity of these stocks to environmental conditions. Here, we overcome this difficulty by collating population time series for forage fish populations that account for nearly two-thirds of global catch of forage fish to identify the fingerprint of fisheries on their population dynamics. Forage fish population collapses shared a set of common and unique characteristics: high fishing pressure for several years before collapse, a sharp drop in natural population productivity, and a lagged response to reduce fishing pressure. Lagged response to natural productivity declines can sharply amplify the magnitude of naturally occurring population fluctuations. Finally, we show that the magnitude and frequency of collapses are greater than expected from natural productivity characteristics and therefore, likely attributed to fishing. The durations of collapses, however, were not different from those expected based on natural productivity shifts. A risk-based management scheme that reduces fishing when populations become scarce would protect forage fish and their predators from collapse with little effect on long-term average catches.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem approaches to natural resource management are seen as a way to provide better outcomes for ecosystems and for people, yet the nature and strength of interactions among ecosystem components is usually unknown. Here we characterize the economic benefits of ecological knowledge through a simple model of fisheries that target a predator (piscivore) and its prey. We solve for the management (harvest) trajectory that maximizes net present value (NPV) for different ecological interactions and initial conditions that represent different levels of exploitation history. Optimal management trajectories generally approached similar harvest levels, but the pathways toward those levels varied considerably by ecological scenario. Application of the wrong harvest trajectory, which would happen if one type of ecological interaction were assumed but in fact another were occurring, generally led to only modest reductions in NPV. However, the risks were not equal across fleets: risks of incurring large losses of NPV and missing management targets were much higher in the fishery targeting piscivores, especially when piscivores were heavily depleted. Our findings suggest that the ecosystem approach might provide the greatest benefits when used to identify system states where management performs poorly with imperfect knowledge of system linkages so that management strategies can be adopted to avoid those states.},

A comprehensive review of 204 potential cases reveals a lack of impact assessments of fisheries co-management. This study reports on a meta-analysis of the impact of fisheries co-management in developing countries in 90 sites across 29 case-studies. The top five most frequently measured process indicators are participation, influence, rule compliance, control over resources, and conflict. The top five most frequently measured outcome indicators are access to resources, resource well-being, fishery yield, household well-being, and household income. To deal with the diversity of the 52 indicators measured and the different ways these data are collected and analysed, we apply a coding system to capture change over time. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that, overall fisheries co-management delivers benefits to end-users through improvements in key process and outcome indicators. However, the dataset as a whole is constituted primarily of data from the Philippines. When we exclude this body of work, few generalisations can be made about the impact of fisheries co-management. The lack of comparative data suitable for impact assessment and the difficulties in comparing data and generalising across countries and regions reiterates calls in other fields for more systematic approaches to understanding and evaluating governance frameworks.},

The responses of fish populations to variability in the marine environment have implications for decision making processes associated with resource management. There is still considerable uncertainty in estimating the responses of tuna populations to short-to-medium-term variability and longer-term change in the oceanic environment. A workshop was organised to examine how advances in oceanography, fisheries science and fisheries economics could be applied to the tuna fisheries of the WCPO and in doing so identify research priorities to improve understanding relevant to progressing management. Research priorities identified included: (i) improved parameterisation of end to end ecosystem model components, processes and feedbacks through expanded biological observations and incorporation of higher resolution climate models; (ii) development of seasonal and inter-annual forecasting tools enabling management responses to short-term variability in tuna distributions and abundances; (iii) improved understanding of the population dynamics of and the energy transfer efficiencies between food web components; (iv) assessment of the optimal value of access rights and overall fishery value under multiple scenarios of tuna distribution and abundance and influences on decision making by fisheries managers and fleets and (v) development of management strategy evaluation frameworks for utilisation in the implementing and testing of fishery management procedures and to help prioritise research directions and investment. Issues discussed and research priorities identified during the workshop have synergies with other internationally managed fisheries and therefore are applicable to many other fisheries.},

  abstract = {The literature on effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity is huge. It is also very diverse, with different authors measuring fragmentation in different ways and, as a consequence, drawing different conclusions regarding both the magnitude and direction of its effects. Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat. Results of empirical studies of habitat fragmentation are often difficult to interpret because (a) many researchers measure fragmentation at the patch scale, not the landscape scale and (b) most researchers measure fragmentation in ways that do not distinguish between habitat loss and habitat fragmentation per se, i.e., the breaking apart of habitat after controlling for habitat loss. Empirical studies to date suggest that habitat loss has large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity. Habitat fragmentation per se has much weaker effects on biodiversity that are at least as likely to be positive as negative. Therefore, to correctly interpret the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity, the effects of these two components of fragmentation must be measured independently. More studies of the independent effects of habitat loss and fragmentation per se are needed to determine the factors that lead to positive versus negative effects of fragmentation per se. I suggest that the term "fragmentation" should be reserved for the breaking apart of habitat, independent of habitat loss.},

Although successional processes are widespread in forests, theoretical work has suggested that differentiation in successional strategy allows only a few species stably to coexist, including only a single shade tolerant. However, this conclusion is based on current niche models, which encode a very simplified view of plant communities, suggesting that the potential for niche differentiation has remained unexplored. Here, we show how extending successional niche models to include features common to all vegetation\textemdash{}height-structured competition for light under a prevailing disturbance regime and two trait-mediated tradeoffs in plant function\textemdash{}enhances the diversity of species that can be maintained, including a diversity of shade tolerants. We identify two distinct axes of potential niche differentiation, corresponding to the traits leaf mass per unit leaf area and height at maturation. The first axis allows for coexistence of different shade tolerances and the second axis for coexistence among species with the same shade tolerance. Addition of this second axis leads to communities with a high diversity of shade tolerants. Niche differentiation along the second axis also generates regions of trait space wherein fitness is almost equalized, an outcome we term ``evolutionarily emergent near-neutrality.'' For different environmental conditions, our model predicts diverse vegetation types and trait mixtures, akin to observations. These results indicate that the outcomes of successional niche differentiation are richer than previously thought and potentially account for mixtures of traits and species observed in forests worldwide.},

The positioning of seafood within the sustainable diet literature is less clear. A literature review was conducted to examine how the environmental impacts of seafood consumption are assessed and what conclusions are being drawn about the inclusion of seafood in a sustainable diet. Seafood is an essential part of the global food system but is not adequately addressed in most of the sustainable diet literature. Aquaculture, the world's fastest growing food sector, was considered by very few papers. Seafood consumption was commonly presented as a dilemma due to the perceived trade-offs between positive health outcomes from eating seafood and concerns of overfishing. A number of studies included seafood as part of their sustainable diet scenario, or as part of a diet that had lower impacts than current consumption. Most of the indicators used were biophysical, with a strong focus on greenhouse gas emissions, and very few studies addressed biological or ecological impacts. The assessment of seafood was limited in many studies due to relevant data sets not being incorporated into the models used. Where they were used, data sources and methodological choices were often not stated thereby limiting the transparency of many studies. Both farmed and wild-capture production methods need to be integrated into research on the impacts of diets and future food scenarios to better understand and promote the benefits of sustainable diets.},

The historical studies suggest that the theoretical possibility of a non-extinction equilibrium is unlikely to hold in practice. Similarly, while privatization in a single species context may appear feasible, in a multi-species context the apparent profitability of privatization may be superseded and the species driven to extinction. The latter conclusion also depends on species-specific characteristics of minimum viable population size and habitat requirements.},

  abstract = {Many species exhibit spatially-varying trends in population size and status, often driven by differences among factors affecting individual subpopulations. Estimation and differentiation of such trends may be important for management, and a driving force for monitoring programs. The ability to estimate spatial differences in population trend may depend on assumptions regarding connectivity among subpopulations (stock structure or spatial overlap in stressors), information that is often poorly known. Linear state space models using the Kalman filter were developed, tested, and applied for trend estimation of pup production for the western Alaska stock of Steller sea lions given only count data. Models were able to estimate trends and abundance even when data were missing. Models that assumed spatial correlation in trend among rookeries were more robust to stock structure assumptions when the stock structure was potentially mis-specified. High levels of spatial correlation among rookeries estimated from Steller sea lion pup count data are consistent with large-scale covariance of population trend within the Steller sea lion metapopulation.},

Thresholds in the response of ecological indicators to system drivers have been suggested as reference points for EBFM, though the management performance of these indicators and possible values for their reference points have not been widely evaluated. We used Management Strategy Evaluation to test the performance of control rules that used ecological indicators to adjust the advice from single-species stock assessments, using the Georges Bank finfish fishery as a case study. We compare the performance of control rules that used ecological indicators to that of single-species FMSY control rules when the system dynamics were governed by the same multispecies population model. Control rules that used indicator-based reference points were able to perform better against catch and biodiversity objectives than when harvests were based on single-species advice alone. Indicators and values for reference points associated with good performance varied depending on the management objective. We quantified tradeoffs between total catch, biodiversity, and interannual variability in catch, noting that it was possible in some instances to achieve higher than average biodiversity while maintaining high catches using indicator-based control rules. While improved performance was noted using ecological indicators, outcomes were variable, and the gains in performance obtained may be similar to alternative methods of implementing precaution in single-species fishery control rules.},

There is still little understanding of the species-specific traits that may constrain or promote successful establishment of populations in temperate regions. We review the factors likely to affect population establishment, including larval supply, settlement and post-settlement processes. In addition, we conduct meta-analyses on existing and new data to examine relationships between species-specific traits and vagrancy. We show that tropical vagrant species are more likely to originate from high-latitude populations, while at the demographic level, tropical fish species with large body size, high swimming ability, large size at settlement and pelagic spawning behaviour are more likely to show successful settlement into temperate habitats. We also show that both habitat and food limitation at settlement and within juvenile stages may constrain tropical vagrant communities to those species with medium to low reliance on coral resources.},

  abstract = {Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) are complex, dynamic, interconnected systems with feedback across social and environmental dimensions. This feedback leads to formidable challenges for causal inference. Two significant challenges involve assumptions about excludability and the absence of interference. These two assumptions have been largely unexplored in the CHANS literature, but when either is violated, causal inferences from observable data are difficult to interpret. To explore their plausibility, structural knowledge of the system is requisite, as is an explicit recognition that most causal variables in CHANS affect a coupled pairing of environmental and human elements. In a large CHANS literature that evaluates marine protected areas, nearly 200 studies attempt to make causal claims, but few address the excludability assumption. To examine the relevance of interference in CHANS, we develop a stylized simulation of a marine CHANS with shocks that can represent policy interventions, ecological disturbances, and technological disasters. Human and capital mobility in CHANS is both a cause of interference, which biases inferences about causal effects, and a moderator of the causal effects themselves. No perfect solutions exist for satisfying excludability and interference assumptions in CHANS. To elucidate causal relationships in CHANS, multiple approaches will be needed for a given causal question, with the aim of identifying sources of bias in each approach and then triangulating on credible inferences. Within CHANS research, and sustainability science more generally, the path to accumulating an evidence base on causal relationships requires skills and knowledge from many disciplines and effective academic-practitioner collaborations.},

We report an experimental study designed to test the long-term impact of three different interventions on household water consumption in South East Queensland. Participants from 221 households were recruited and completed an initial survey, and their houses were fitted with smart water meters which measured total water usage at 5~s intervals. Households were allocated into one of four conditions: a control group and three interventions groups (water saving information alone, information plus a descriptive norm manipulation, and information plus tailored end-user feedback). The study is the first to use smart water metering technology as a tool for behaviour change as well as a way to test the effectiveness of demand management interventions. Growth curve modelling revealed that compared to the control, the three intervention groups all showed reduced levels of household consumption (an average reduction of 11.3~L per person per day) over the course of the interventions, and for some months afterwards. All interventions led to significant water savings, but long-term household usage data showed that in all cases, the reduction in water use resulting from the interventions eventually dissipated, with water consumption returning to pre-intervention levels after approximately 12 months. Implications for water demand management programs are discussed.},

The ``Malthusian overfishing narrative'' suggests that overfishing is driven by too many fishers chasing too few fish and that fishing effort grows proportionately to human population growth, requiring policy interventions that reduce fisher access, the number of fishers, or the human population. By neglecting other drivers of overfishing that may be more directly related to fishing pressure and provide more tangible policy levers for achieving fisheries sustainability, Malthusian overfishing relegates blame to regions of the world with high population growth rates, while consumers, corporations and political systems responsible for these other mediating drivers remain unexamined. While social\textendash{}ecological systems literature has provided alternatives to the Malthusian paradigm, its focus on institutions and organized social units often fails to address fundamental issues of power and politics that have inhibited the design and implementation of effective fisheries policy. Here, we apply a political ecology lens to unpack Malthusian overfishing and, relying upon insights derived from the social sciences, reconstruct the narrative incorporating four exemplar mediating drivers: technology and innovation, resource demand and distribution, marginalization and equity, and governance and management. We argue that a more nuanced understanding of such factors will lead to effective and equitable fisheries policies and programmes, by identifying a suite of policy levers designed to address the root causes of overfishing in diverse contexts.},

Rather, unsustainable behaviors result from a vicious cycle, where traditional market and state institutions reinforce disincentives for more sustainable behaviors while, at the same time, the institutions of civil society lack momentum to effectively promote fundamental reforms of those institutions. Achieving more sustainable behaviors requires this cycle to be broken.

  abstract = {Spiny lobsters are highly valuable seafood species that are captured and marketed in more than 90 countries. After more than 30 years of stable catches, spiny lobster fisheries in many parts of the world are declining due to decreased recruitment. The planktonic larvae spend up to 2 years in offshore waters, accumulating energy stores to fuel the non-feeding post-larva, or puerulus, to actively migrate onshore and settle. The total energy required by spiny lobster pueruli for cross-shelf migration has not been accurately determined. Recent advances in larval culture have provided the opportunity for the first detailed examination of the swimming performance, respiratory metabolism and nitrogen excretion of spiny lobster (Sagmariasus verreauxi) throughout the puerulus stage. The routine and active metabolic rates of pueruli were lower than for most other decapod larvae, probably to provide greater energy efficiency. However, pueruli were found to have limited time, swimming ability and fuel for active cross-shelf migration. It is estimated that S. verreauxi pueruli require at least 13.8 mg of stored lipid to provide sufficient energy (18.4\% DW) to complete the puerulus stage and recruit to coastal habitats. The ability of the preceding phyllosoma larvae to accumulate these reserves, and the presence of favourable oceanographic conditions during the limited time available to the migrating puerulus, are both crucial to subsequent successful recruitment. Spiny lobster recruitment processes appear to be particularly vulnerable to changes in oceanic climate which is likely to contribute to the recent large-scale declines in recruitment to valuable fished populations.},

This complexity was reduced to a level useful for management by consolidating the individual risks into 60 regional-level risks, with a multi-criteria analysis used to integrate the ecological, social and economic risks into just 24 Departmental-level priorities, which ranged from very low to urgent. Given this success, EBFM-based priorities now form the basis for the Department's budget planning process, plus the framework is providing a critical link between fishery level issues and the broader processes undertaken by other marine based agencies.

Advice to the Australian and Queensland governments that supported this initiative predicted these additional closures would generate minimal (10\%) initial reductions in both catch and landed value within the GBR area with recovery of catches becoming apparent after three years.  To test these predictions, commercial fisheries data from the GBR area and from the two adjacent (non-GBR) areas of Queensland were compared for the periods immediately prior to, and after the closures were implemented. The observed means for total annual catch and value within the GBR declined from pre-closure (2000-2003) levels of 12,780t and \$160 million, to initial post-closure (2005-2008) levels of 8,143t and \$102 million; decreases of 35\% and 36\% respectively.  Because the reference areas in the non-GBR had minimal changes in catch and value, the beyond-BACI analyses estimated initial net-reductions within the GBR of 35\% for both total catch and value.  There was no evidence of recovery in total catch levels or any comparative improvement in catch-rates within the GBR nine years after implementation.  These results are not consistent with the advice to governments that the closures would have minimal initial impacts and rapidly generate benefits to fisheries in the GBR through increased juvenile recruitment and adult 'spillovers'.  Instead, the absence of evidence of recovery in catches or catch-rates to date currently support an alternative hypothesis that where there is already effective fisheries management, the closing of areas to all fishing will generate reductions in overall catches similar to the percentage of the fished area that is closed.},

Given the cost of such monitoring programs, and the degraded state of many of the world's reefs, understanding how reef monitoring data can be used to shape management decisions for coral reefs is a high priority. However, there is no general guide to understanding the ecological implications of the data in a format that can trigger a management response. We attempt to provide such a guide for interpreting the temporal trends in 41 coral reef monitoring attributes, recorded by seven of the largest reef monitoring programmes. We show that only a small subset of these attributes is required to identify the stressors that have impacted a reef (i.e. provide a diagnosis), as well as to estimate the likely recovery potential (prognosis). Two of the most useful indicators, turf algal canopy height and coral colony growth rate are not commonly measured, and we strongly recommend their inclusion in reef monitoring. The diagnosis and prognosis system that we have developed may help guide management actions and provides a foundation for further development as biological and ecological insights continue to grow.},

This article presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960\textendash{}1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social\textendash{}ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge\textendash{}system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services.},

First, a comparative review of fishery statistics is developed. Recent catches on fads by purse seiners can be estimated at a level of one million tons yearly. This comparison allows to describe the fishing zones and catch trends over time, the species composition and size taken in the various fad fisheries. Skipjack tuna is the dominant species in most fad fisheries, but significant amounts of yellowfin and bigeye are also frequently taken under fads. The paper also presents an overview of various observer data concerning the by-catches of the various fisheries using fads. This comparison allows to estimate the total worldwide yearly by-catches at about 100,000 t, and their species composition in each ocean. The fad technology used in the various oceans by purse seiners is described. The recent use of fads by purse seiners has introduced major uncertainties in most stock assessments, because analyses are hampered by changes in the fishing effort in a fad fishery, by changes in fishing zones and in sizes caught. As a last point, the management of fads presently done or in view by the various tuna bodies are introduced. It appears that the present massive use of fads worldwide is perhaps an unsafe fishing mode, which could produce serious overfishing of many stocks. There is then a consensus that the use of fads needs to be controlled and limited to sustainable biological levels.},

  abstract = {No-take marine reserves (NTRs) may promote recovery of exploited populations within their boundaries and spillover of fishes to adjacent fishing grounds, thus potentially benefiting the local fisheries. Although some studies have measured spillover by examining gradients of fish abundance and body size across reserve boundaries, there are no such studies to date including information from before reserve establishment, thus seriously limiting interpretation of results. We measured reef fish spillover from a NTR (Itacolomis Reef, Eastern Brazil) by estimating biomass and body size across the reserve boundary before (2001) and after (2002\textendash{}2005) initiation of protection. Replicate sites were sampled inside and outside the reserve, with unprotected sites included in three distance categories from the reserve boundary: 0\textendash{}400, 400\textendash{}800 and 800\textendash{}1200m. This latter category generally surpasses the scales over which spillover is expected to influence patterns of fish abundance outside reserves (generally {$<$}500m), particularly for relatively sedentary fishes, thus acting as a control for the reserve effect. Habitat measurements were undertaken at the same sites, from 2003 on. Biomass of Scarus trispinosus, a major fishery resource and the dominant species in terms of biomass (37.4\% of total biomass), was lower inside the reserve area before its establishment. During this same period, no individuals of two primary target species, Mycteroperca bonaci and Sparisoma axillare, were recorded inside the reserve. Coral cover was consistently lower inside the reserve from 2003 on. Biomass and body size of M. bonaci, as well as biomass of Ocyurus chrysurus, increased continuously inside the reserve after its establishment, with no similar increases recorded in control sites. Evidences of spillover (i.e. higher biomass inside the reserve and in unprotected sites closer to its boundary) were obtained for M. bonaci, O. chrysurus and S. trispinosus, although this pattern was only marginally significant for O. chrysurus. Despite these positive signs, recovery and spillover of S. trispinosus were probably inhibited by increased poaching from 2003 on. Our results indicate that the NTR at Itacolomis Reef was established a priori on poor quality habitats. Thus, future spatial comparisons between protected and unprotected sites would underestimate changes due to protection. These findings highlight the importance of baseline information and continued monitoring for adequately understanding the effects of NTRs, as well as the need of closer collaboration between natural and social scientists in order to effectively protect high-quality habitats in the long term while accounting for the socio-economic needs of local fishing communities.},

  abstract = {The conclusions drawn from fisheries stock assessment models can depend strongly on the relative weights assigned to different data sets. However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved., Les conclusions tir{\'e}es des mod{\`e}les d'{\'e}valuation des stocks des p{\^e}ches d{\'e}pendent fortement des poids relatifs attribu{\'e}s aux diff{\'e}rents ensembles de donn{\'e}es.

In the light of subsequent literature and experience, four topics seemed in need of increased emphasis or elaboration. (1) For composition data, it is better to think in terms of ``right-weighting'' (i.e., weighting that is statistically appropriate) than ``down-weighting''. (2) The sensitivity of some assessments to changes in weighting can sometimes be reduced by restructuring to reduce model misspecification; this is a good idea, but should be seen as complementary to data weighting, rather than an alternative to it. (3) It seems typical that more than half of the variance of composition residuals arises from process error (arising from model misspecification) rather than observation error. (4) Changing the likelihood for composition data from the multinomial to the Dirichlet-multinomial has some advantages but is not without problems. Some new topics are discussed: most iterative reweighting of composition data is multiplicative, but additive methods deserve consideration; data weighting is more complicated in state-space models; catch data should not be subject to data weighting; there are significant disadvantages in structuring age-related observations of fishery and survey catches as frequencies, rather than compositions (i.e., as numbers, rather than proportions); methods of weighting three additional data types (conditional age at length, tagging abundance; and tagging length-increment) are described.},

Despite the imposition of strict management measures in force since the early 1990s, the Scotian Shelf ecosystem has not reverted back to its former structure. Here we provide evidence of the transient nature of this ecosystem and its current return path towards benthic fish species domination. The prolonged duration of the altered food web, and its current recovery, was and is being governed by the oscillatory, runaway consumption dynamics of the forage fish complex. These erupting forage species, which reached biomass levels 900\% greater than those prevalent during the pre-collapse years of large benthic predators, are now in decline, having outstripped their zooplankton food supply. This dampening, and the associated reduction in the intensity of predation, was accompanied by lagged increases in species abundances at both lower and higher trophic levels, first witnessed in zooplankton and then in large-bodied predators, all consistent with a return towards the earlier ecosystem structure. We conclude that the reversibility of perturbed ecosystems can occur and that this bodes well for other collapsed fisheries.},

We review which theories from biogeography have been incorporated into marine spatial planning and which relevant concepts have yet to be translated to inform the next generation of design principles. This biogeographic perspective will only become more relevant as climate change amplifies these spatial and temporal dynamics, and as species begin to shift in and out of existing MPAs. The scale of climate velocities predicted for the 21st century dwarfs all but the largest MPAs currently in place, raising the possibility that in coming decades many MPAs will no longer contain the species or assemblages they were established to protect. We present a number of design elements that could improve the success of MPAs and MPA networks in light of biogeographic processes and climate change. Biogeographically informed MPA networks of the future may resemble the habitat corridors currently being considered for many terrestrial regions.},

Fisheries provide food and support livelihoods across the world. They are also under extreme pressure, with many stocks overfished and poorly managed. Climate change will add to the burden fish stocks bear, but such impacts remain largely unknown. Free et al. used temperature-specific models and hindcasting across fish stocks to determine the degree to which warming has, and will, affect fish species (see the Perspective by Plag{\'a}nyi). They found that an overall reduction in yield has occurred over the past 80 years. Furthermore, although some species are predicted to respond positively to warming waters, the majority will experience a negative impact on growth. As our world warms, responsible and active management of fisheries harvests will become even more important.
Science, this issue p. 979; see also p. 930
Climate change is altering habitats for marine fishes and invertebrates, but the net effect of these changes on potential food production is unknown. We used temperature-dependent population models to measure the influence of warming on the productivity of 235 populations of 124 species in 38 ecoregions. Some populations responded significantly positively (n = 9 populations) and others responded significantly negatively (n = 19 populations) to warming, with the direction and magnitude of the response explained by ecoregion, taxonomy, life history, and exploitation history. Hindcasts indicate that the maximum sustainable yield of the evaluated populations decreased by 4.1\% from 1930 to 2010, with five ecoregions experiencing losses of 15 to 35\%. Outcomes of fisheries management\textemdash{}including long-term food provisioning\textemdash{}will be improved by accounting for changing productivity in a warmer ocean.

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Although climate change is altering the productivity and distribution of marine fisheries, climate-adaptive fisheries management could mitigate many of the negative impacts on human society. We forecast global fisheries biomass, catch, and profits to 2100 under three climate scenarios (RCPs 4.5, 6.0, 8.5) and five levels of management reform to (1) determine the impact of climate change on national fisheries and (2) quantify the national-scale benefits of implementing climate-adaptive fisheries reforms. Management reforms accounting for shifting productivity and shifting distributions would yield higher catch and profits in the future relative to today for 60-65\% of countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but for only 35\% of countries under the most severe scenario. Furthermore, these management reforms would yield higher cumulative catch and profits than business-as-usual management for nearly all countries under the two least severe climate scenarios but would yield lower cumulative catch for 40\% of countries under the most severe scenario. Fortunately, perfect fisheries management is not necessary to achieve these benefits: transboundary cooperation with 5-year intervals between adaptive interventions would result in comparable outcomes. However, the ability for realistic management reforms to offset the negative impacts of climate change is bounded by changes in underlying biological productivity. Although realistic reforms could generate higher catch and profits for 23-50\% of countries experiencing reductions in productivity, the remaining countries would need to develop, expand, and reform aquaculture and other food production sectors to offset losses in capture fisheries. Still, climate-adaptive management is more profitable than business-as-usual management in all countries and we provide guidance on implementing \textendash{} and achieving the benefits of \textendash{} climate-adaptive fisheries reform along a gradient of scientific, management, and enforcement capacities.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

One class of these methods requires only catch time series and, in some cases, information about life history or fishery characteristics, to estimate stock status. These catch-only methods (COMs) range from statistical models trained on data-rich stocks to mechanistic population models that make assumptions about changes in fishing effort. We review 11 COMs, comparing performance through application to data-rich stocks and simulated fisheries. The catch-only methods evaluated here produce imprecise and biased estimates of B/BMSY, especially for stocks that are lightly exploited. They were also generally poor classifiers of stock status. While no method performed best across all stocks, ensembles of multiple COMs generally performed better than individual COMs. We advocate for testing new COMs using this common platform. We also caution that performance in estimating stock status is not sufficient for gauging the usefulness of COMs in managing fisheries. Greater use of management strategy evaluation is needed before COMs can be considered a reliable tool for management.},

  abstract = {Paleontological and historical stock abundance estimates indicate that pelagic fish populations inhabiting upwelling ecosystems undergo large interdecadal variations in abundance with amplitudes equal to, if not larger than, the interannual variability. The interdecadal variability is characterized by periods of high and low abundance, termed ``pseudo-cycles'', because of their irregular periodicity. Fisheries targeting small pelagic fish suffer from overall overcapitalization, like many other fisheries, but also from an additional overcapitalization problem: a phase displacement between rapid fish population decreases and a slower disinvestment which follows. This lag produces economic hardship.

Here we document the fish:fishery relationship for the Peruvian anchoveta. Anchoveta pseudo-cycles of 20 to \&gt;100 years are observed, with the present stock abundance most likely located near upper part of the cycle. Fleet overcapacity expressed as the proportion of unused present capacity is estimated at 72\% and processing overcapacity at 89\%. A simple bio-economic model demonstrates the risks associated with the pseudo-periodicity in fish stock abundance in conjunction with fishery investment, open access, and overcapacity: a timing bomb for the fishing sector. The lag between disinvestment and decrease in fish abundance is quantified. A reduction of the fishing and processing capacity and measures to decrease the investment lag are recommended to limit the social, economical and political tensions that will result from the expected decrease in stock abundance. Finally, some management options to reduce these risks are discussed.},

Recent developments of new habitat-mapping techniques make this advice more achievable, but the success of such an approach depends largely on our ability to define habitat types in a way that is ecologically relevant. We devised and tested the ecological relevance of a set of habitat-type definitions through our participation in a stakeholder-driven process to design a network of MPAs, focusing on no-take marine reserves in the Seaflower Biosphere Reserve, San Andr{\'e}s Archipelago, Colombia. A priori definitions of habitat types were ecologically relevant, in that our habitat-type definitions corresponded to identifiable and unique characteristics in the ecological communities found there. The identification of ecological pathways and connectivity among habitats also helped in designing ecologically relevant reserve boundaries. Our findings contributed to the overall design process, along with our summary of other general principles of marine reserve design.

  abstract = {Reducing food production pressures on the environment while feeding an ever-growing human population is one of the grand challenges facing humanity. The magnitude of environmental impacts from food production, largely around land use, has motivated evaluation of the environmental and health benefits of shifting diets, typically away from meat toward other sources, including seafood. However, total global catch of wild seafood has remained relatively unchanged for the last two decades, suggesting increased demand for seafood will mostly have to rely on aquaculture (i.e., aquatic farming). Increasingly, cultivated aquatic species depend on feed inputs from agricultural sources, raising concerns around further straining crops and land use for feed. However, the relative impact and potential of aquaculture remains unclear. Here we simulate how different forms of aquaculture contribute and compare with feed and land use of terrestrial meat production and how spatial patterns might change by midcentury if diets move toward more cultured seafood and less meat. Using country-level aquatic and terrestrial data, we show that aquaculture requires less feed crops and land, even if over one-third of protein production comes from aquaculture by 2050. However, feed and land-sparing benefits are spatially heterogeneous, driven by differing patterns of production, trade, and feed composition. Ultimately, our study highlights the future potential and uncertainties of considering aquaculture in the portfolio of sustainability solutions around one of the largest anthropogenic impacts on the planet.},

Application of these indicators to stocks of Gadus morhua, Sardinella aurita and Epinephelus aeneus demonstrate their usefulness. It is argued that such simple indicators have the potential to allow more stakeholders such as fishers, fish dealers, supermarket managers, consumers and politicians to participate in fisheries management and eventually hold and reverse the global pattern of convenience overfishing, which is defined here as deliberate overfishing sanctioned by official bodies who find it more convenient to risk eventual collapse of fish stocks than to risk social and political conflicts.},

  abstract = {In this study we show how substantial gains towards the goals of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) can be achieved by different single-species management. We show that fishing has much less impact on stocks if fish are caught after they have reached the size (Lopt) where growth rate and cohort biomass are maximum. To demonstrate our point we compare the impact of three fishing scenarios on 9 stocks from the North Sea and the Baltic. Scenario (1) is the current fishing regime, scenario (2) is a new management regime proposed by the European Commission, aiming for maximum sustainable yield obtained from all stocks, and scenario (3) is set so that it achieves the same yield as scenario (2), albeit with fishing on sizes beyond Lopt. Results show that scenarios (2) and (3) are significant improvements compared to current fishing practice. However, scenario (3) consistently shows least impact on the stocks, with seven-fold higher biomass of demersal fishes and an age structure similar to an unfished stock. This allows juveniles and adults to better fulfil their ecological roles, a major step towards the goals of ecosystem-based fisheries management. We give examples where scenario (3) is practiced in successful fisheries. We present a new interpretation of the relative yield per recruit isopleth diagram with indication of a new target area for fisheries operating within the context of EBFM. We present a new expression of the relative biomass per recruit isopleth diagram, which supports our analysis. We conclude that size matters for precautionary and ecosystem-based fisheries management and present a list of additional advantages associated with fishing at Lopt.},

Here, we propose a set of intuitive harvest control rules that are economically sound, compliant with international fishery agreements, based on relevant international experiences, supportive of ecosystem-based fisheries management and compatible with the biology of the fish stocks. The rules are based on the concept of maximum sustainable yield (MSY), with a precautionary target biomass that is 30\% larger than that which produces MSY and with annual catches of 91\%MSY. Allowable catches decline steeply when stocks fall below MSY levels and are set to zero when stocks fall below half of MSY levels. We show that the proposed rules could have prevented the collapse of the North Sea herring in the 1970s and that they can deal with strong cyclic variations in recruitment such as known for blue whiting. Compared to the current system, these rules would lead to higher long-term catches from larger stocks at lower cost and with less adverse environmental impact.},

We show explicitly that trends in catch data are not an artifact of the applied method and are consistent with trends in biomass data of fully assessed stocks. We also show that, while comprehensive stock assessments are the preferred method for evaluating single stocks, they are a biased subsample of the stocks in a given area, strongly underestimating the percentage of collapsed stocks. We concur with a recent assessment-based analysis by FAO that the increasing trends in the percentage of overexploited, depleted, and recovering stocks and the decreasing trends in underexploited and moderately exploited stocks give cause for concern. We show that these trends are much more pronounced if all available data are considered.},

We still believe that the size-spectrum models used to justify BH were highly unrealistic and not suitable for evaluating real-world fishing strategies. We agree with Andersen et al. that BH is unlikely to be a useful guiding principle for ecosystem-based fisheries management, for many reasons. The use of unrealistic models is one of them.},

Special emphasis was given to derive informative priors for productivity, unexploited stock size, catchability and biomass from population dynamics theory. Both models gave good predictions of the maximum intrinsic rate of population increase r, unexploited stock size k and maximum sustainable yield MSY when validated against simulated data with known parameter values. CMSY provided, in addition, reasonable predictions of relative biomass and exploitation rate. Both models were evaluated against 128 real stocks, where estimates of biomass were available from full stock assessments. BSM estimates of r, k and MSY were used as benchmarks for the respective CMSY estimates and were not significantly different in 76\% of the stocks. A similar test against 28 data-limited stocks, where CPUE instead of biomass was available, showed that BSM and CMSY estimates of r, k and MSY were not significantly different in 89\% of the stocks. Both CMSY and BSM combine the production model with a simple stock\textendash{}recruitment model, accounting for reduced recruitment at severely depleted stock sizes.},

Here we use conventional bioeconomic theory to demonstrate that inherent biological constraints combined with nonlinear supply-demand relationships can generate threshold effects due to harvesting. As a result, increases in overall demand due to human population growth or improvement in real income would be expected to induce critical transitions from high-yield/low-price fisheries to low-yield/high-price fisheries, generating severe strains on social and economic systems as well as compromising resource conservation goals. As a proof of concept, we show that key predictions of the critical transition hypothesis are borne out in oceanic fisheries (cod and pollock) that have experienced substantial increase in fishing pressure over the past 60 y. A hump-shaped relationship between price and historical harvest returns, well demonstrated in these empirical examples, is particularly diagnostic of fishery degradation. Fortunately, the same heuristic can also be used to identify reliable targets for fishery restoration yielding optimal bioeconomic returns while safely conserving resource abundance.},

  abstract = {Because conventional markets value only certain goods or services in the ocean (e.g. fish), other services provided by coastal and marine ecosystems that are not priced, paid for, or stewarded tend to become degraded. In fact, the very capacity of an ecosystem to produce a valued good or service is often reduced because conventional markets value only certain goods and services, rather than the productive capacity. Coastal socio-ecosystems are particularly susceptible to these market failures due to the lack of clear property rights, strong dependence on resource extraction, and other factors. Conservation strategies aimed at protecting unvalued coastal ecosystem services through regulation or spatial management (e.g. Marine Protected Areas) can be effective but often result in lost revenue and adverse social impacts, which, in turn, create conflict and opposition. Here, we describe `ecomarkets' \textendash{} markets and financial tools \textendash{} that could, under the right conditions, generate value for broad portfolios of coastal ecosystem services while maintaining ecosystem structure and function by addressing the unique problems of the coastal zone, including the lack of clear management and exclusion rights. Just as coastal tenure and catch-share systems generate meaningful conservation and economic outcomes, it is possible to imagine other market mechanisms that do the same with respect to a variety of other coastal ecosystem goods and services. Rather than solely relying on extracting goods, these approaches could allow communities to diversify ecosystem uses and focus on long-term stewardship and conservation, while meeting development, food security, and human welfare goals. The creation of ecomarkets will be difficult in many cases, because rights and responsibilities must be devolved, new social contracts will be required, accountability systems must be created and enforced, and long-term patterns of behaviour must change. We argue that efforts to overcome these obstacles are justified, because these deep changes will strongly complement policies and tools such as Marine Protected Areas, coastal spatial management, and regulation, thereby helping to bring coastal conservation to scale.},

  abstract = {Coral reefs support numerous ornamental fisheries, but there are concerns about stock sustainability due to the volume of animals caught. Such impacts are difficult to quantify and manage because fishery data are often lacking. Here, we suggest a framework that integrates several data-poor assessment and management methods in order to provide management guidance for fisheries that differ widely in the kinds and amounts of data available. First, a resource manager could assess the status of the ecosystem (using quantitative metrics where data are available and semi-quantitative risk assessment where they are not) and determine whether overall fishing mortality should be reduced. Next, productivity susceptibility analysis can be used to estimate vulnerability to fishing using basic information on life history and the nature of the fishery. Information on the relative degree of exploitation (e.g. export data or ratios of fish density inside and outside no-take marine reserves) is then combined with the vulnerability ranks to prioritize species for precautionary management and further analysis. For example, species that are both highly exploited and vulnerable are good candidates for precautionary reductions in allowable capture. Species that appear to be less vulnerable could be managed on a stock-specific basis to prevent over-exploitation of some species resulting from the use of aggregate catch limits. The framework could be applied to coral reef ornamental fisheries which typically lack landings, catch-per-unit-effort and age-size data to generate management guidance to reduce overfishing risk. We illustrate the application of this framework to an ornamental fishery in Indonesia.},

  abstract = {Many ecological indicators have been proposed to detect and describe the effects of fishing on marine ecosystems, but few have been evaluated formally. Here, simulation models of two marine systems off southeastern Australia (a large marine embayment, and an EEZ-scale regional marine ecosystem) are used to evaluate the performance of a suite of ecological indicators. The indicators cover species, assemblages, habitats, and ecosystems, including quantities derived from models such as Ecopath. The simulation models, based on the Atlantis framework, incorporate the effects of fishing from several fishing gears, and also the confounding impacts of other broad-scale pressures on the ecosystems (e.g. increased nutrient loads). These models are used to provide fishery-dependent and fishery-independent pseudo-data from which the indicators are calculated. Indicator performance is quantified by the ability to detect and/or predict trends in key variables of interest (``attributes''), the true values of which are known from the simulation models. The performance of each indicator is evaluated across a range of ecological and fishing scenarios. Results suggest that indicators at the community level of organization are the most reliable, and that it is necessary to use a variety of indicators simultaneously to detect the full range of impacts from fishing. Several key functional groups provide a good characterization of ecosystem state, or indicate the cause of broader ecosystem changes in most instances.},

While many of these are taking the form of generic modelling frameworks, no one approach defines end-to-end ecosystem modelling. There is a wide range of scales, resolutions, forcings, components and represented processes. Examples drawn from existing models can be used to give guidance on best practice approaches for creating end-to-end models. In particular, it is clear that defaulting to the finest resolution and greatest complexity in all the dimensions (e.g. spatial, temporal, taxonomic, process detail) is not beneficial. There is also a lot of value, during model development and implementation, in trying different model types, assumptions and formulations; there is no one ``best'' model. Maintaining a diversity of approaches is important given that end-to-end models are most effective when used as strategic tools, to address questions that are at scales where there is still a lot of uncertainty about how systems function. There are still many challenges facing the end-to-end modelling field, particularly when long simulation periods are called for, but perhaps the greatest ones are: non-stationarity introduced by shifting climate, biodiversity and evolution; representing human responses; and handling uncertainty.},

  abstract = {There is broad consensus that the main problem facing fisheries globally is too many boats chasing too few fish. Unfortunately it is also possible to argue that there are too many proposed solutions and not enough practical answers to improving fisheries management. There is a deepening divide between those who propose alternative regulatory controls on fishers, including establishing large areas permanently closed to fishing, and those who argue for better alignment of incentives combined with broad participation of resource users in fishery management decisions (in simple terms, between top down and bottom up systems of governance). However despite the choice of policy instruments used, a consistent outcome is that resource users behave in a manner that is often unintended by the designers of the management system. Hence whilst uncertainty is broadly recognized as a pervasive feature of fisheries management, to date most of the attention has focussed on only part of that uncertainty \textendash{} scientific uncertainty about the status of exploited resources. The effect of uncertainty generated on the human side of fisheries science and management has received much less attention. However, the uncertainty generated by unexpected resource user behaviour is critical as it has unplanned consequences and leads to unintended management outcomes. Using empirical evidence of unexpected resource user behaviour and reviewing current responses to unexpected management outcomes, we identify different approaches that both improve prediction of human behaviour in fisheries systems and identify management measures that are more robust to these sources of uncertainty. However, unless the micro scale drivers of human behaviour that contribute to macro scale implementation uncertainty are communicated effectively to managers and considered more regularly and in greater depth, unanticipated responses to management actions will continue to undermine management systems and threaten the sustainability of fisheries.},

  abstract = {Models are key tools for integrating a wide range of system information in a common framework. Attempts to model exploited marine ecosystems can increase understanding of system dynamics; identify major processes, drivers and responses; highlight major gaps in knowledge; and provide a mechanism to `road test' management strategies before implementing them in reality. The Atlantis modelling framework has been used in these roles for a decade and is regularly being modified and applied to new questions (e.g. it is being coupled to climate, biophysical and economic models to help consider climate change impacts, monitoring schemes and multiple use management). This study describes some common lessons learned from its implementation, particularly in regard to when these tools are most effective and the likely form of best practices for ecosystem-based management (EBM). Most importantly, it highlighted that no single management lever is sufficient to address the many trade-offs associated with EBM and that the mix of measures needed to successfully implement EBM will differ between systems and will change through time. Although it is doubtful that any single management action will be based solely on Atlantis, this modelling approach continues to provide important insights for managers when making natural resource management decisions.},

Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is a tool that has been widely used to develop and test single species fisheries management strategies and is now being extended to support ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM). We describe the application of MSE to investigate alternative strategies for achieving EBFM goals for a complex multispecies fishery in southeastern Australia. The study was undertaken as part of a stakeholder driven process to review and improve the ecological, economic and social performance of the fishery. An integrated management strategy, involving combinations of measures including quotas, gear controls and spatial management, performed best against a wide range of objectives and this strategy was subsequently adopted in the fishery, leading to marked improvements in performance. Although particular to one fishery, the conclusion that an integrated package of measures outperforms single focus measures we argue is likely to apply widely in fisheries that aim to achieve EBFM goals.},

  abstract = {Models provide useful insights into conservation and resource management issues and solutions. Their use to date has highlighted conditions under which no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) may help us to achieve the goals of ecosystem-based management by reducing pressures, and where they might fail to achieve desired goals. For example, static reserve designs are unlikely to achieve desired objectives when applied to mobile species or when compromised by climate-related ecosystem restructuring and range shifts. Modelling tools allow planners to explore a range of options, such as basing MPAs on the presence of dynamic oceanic features, and to evaluate the potential future impacts of alternative interventions compared with `no-action' counterfactuals, under a range of environmental and development scenarios. The modelling environment allows the analyst to test if indicators and management strategies are robust to uncertainties in how the ecosystem (and the broader human\textendash{}ecosystem combination) operates, including the direct and indirect ecological effects of protection. Moreover, modelling results can be presented at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and relative to ecological, economic and social objectives. This helps to reveal potential `surprises', such as regime shifts, trophic cascades and bottlenecks in human responses. Using illustrative examples, this paper briefly covers the history of the use of simulation models for evaluating MPA options, and discusses their utility and limitations for informing protected area management in the marine realm.},

  abstract = {Several fisheries jurisdictions are aiming to achieve risk equivalency (here defined as the probability of a stock being depleted below a limit reference point or not being maintained at a target reference point) irrespective of the stock assessment method used to provide management advice and the amount of data available. Risk equivalency is implicitly required under the USA Magnuson-Stevens Act, while in Australia it is an explicit component of the Australian Commonwealth Government's Harvest Strategy Policy. Risk equivalency is well understood, but few fisheries have attempted to implement it. The Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF) is the only Australian fishery that has explicitly done so, albeit in a semi-arbitrary manner. Assessments and associated harvest strategies are placed into tiers from data-rich to data-limited. There are also meta-rules that control how much catch limits can change from one year to the next, and buffers by tier to achieve risk equivalency. Here, the SESSF tier system was evaluated in an ecosystem context using Management Strategy Evaluation. Two buffer systems were considered, the current SESSF system and a system inferred from how the Acceptable Biological Catches are set for the USA west coast groundfish fishery. Harvest strategies for all tiers were capable of moving productive stocks so their biomasses lay between the limit and target reference points. The USA buffer system was more conservative than the SESSF system, and achieved the fastest recovery for depleted stocks. The latter system led to slightly lower total catches, but was closest to achieving risk equivalency across the tiers. The USA buffer system led to biomass trajectories most similar to those when the system was managed so that biomass moves as rapidly as possible to its target reference point.},

The MCA is based on an additive utility model. The relative importance of partial objectives of forest management (carbon sequestration, ground water recharge, biodiversity, and timber production) is defined in cooperation with stakeholders. The forest growth model 4C (Forest Ecosystems in a Changing Environment) is used to simulate the impact of six forest management strategies and climate on forest functions. Two climate change scenarios represent uncertainties with regard to future climatic conditions. The study is based on actual forest conditions in the Kleinsee management unit in east Germany, which is dominated by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and oak (Quercus robur L. and Quercus petraea Liebl.) stands. First, there is an analysis of the impact of climate and forest management on forest functions. Climate change increases carbon sequestration and income from timber production due to increased stand productivity. Secondly, the overall utility of the management strategies is compared under the priority settings of different stakeholder groups. From an ecological perspective, a conservation strategy would be preferable under all climate scenarios, but the business as usual management would also fit the expectations under the current climate due to high biodiversity and carbon sequestration in the forest ecosystem. In contrast, a forest manager in public-owned forests or a private forest owner would prefer a management strategy with an intermediate thinning intensity and a high share of pine stands to enhance income from timber production while maintaining the other forest functions.},

  abstract = {The pun in the above title reflects two points. First, marine life cycles commonly include a dispersive juvenile stage that is moved about by ocean currents. This stage often is the predominant, or only, means of dispersal that connects spatially disjunct populations. As a consequence, details of dispersal likely play a critical role in determining the effectiveness of marine reserves as a management and conservation tool. Curiously, however (and this is the second point of the title), although dozens of models for marine reserves now exist, few actually account explicitly for larval dispersal. Moreover, those that do include dispersal, do so almost exclusively by considering it to be a nondirectional spreading process (diffusion), ignoring the effects of directional transport by currents (advection). Here we develop a population dynamical model for marine organisms with relatively sedentary adults whose larvae are transported in a simple flow field with both diffusive spreading and directional characteristics. We find that advection can play a dominant role in determining the effectiveness of different reserve configurations. Two of the most important consequences are: (1) with strong currents, multiple reserves can be markedly more effective than single reserves of equivalent total size; and (2) in the presence of strong currents, reserves can significantly outperform traditional, effort-based management strategies in terms of fisheries yield, and do so with less risk. These results suggest that successful reserve design may require considerable new efforts to examine explicitly the role of dispersal of young.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) that exclude fishing have been shown repeatedly to enhance the abundance, size, and diversity of species. These benefits, however, mean little to most marine species, because individual protected areas typically are small. To meet the larger-scale conservation challenges facing ocean ecosystems, several nations are expanding the benefits of individual protected areas by building networks of protected areas. Doing so successfully requires a detailed understanding of the ecological and physical characteristics of ocean ecosystems and the responses of humans to spatial closures. There has been enormous scientific interest in these topics, and frameworks for the design of MPA networks for meeting conservation and fishery management goals are emerging. Persistent in the literature is the perception of an inherent tradeoff between achieving conservation and fishery goals. Through a synthetic analysis across these conservation and bioeconomic studies, we construct guidelines for MPA network design that reduce or eliminate this tradeoff. We present size, spacing, location, and configuration guidelines for designing networks that simultaneously can enhance biological conservation and reduce fishery costs or even increase fishery yields and profits. Indeed, in some settings, a well-designed MPA network is critical to the optimal harvest strategy. When reserves benefit fisheries, the optimal area in reserves is moderately large (mode {$\approx$}30\%). Assessing network design principals is limited currently by the absence of empirical data from large-scale networks. Emerging networks will soon rectify this constraint.},

  abstract = {The world's oceans supply food and livelihood to billions of people, yet species' shifting geographic ranges and changes in productivity arising from climate change are expected to profoundly affect these benefits. We ask how improvements in fishery management can offset the negative consequences of climate change; we find that the answer hinges on the current status of stocks. The poor current status of many stocks combined with potentially maladaptive responses to range shifts could reduce future global fisheries yields and profits even more severely than previous estimates have suggested. However, reforming fisheries in ways that jointly fix current inefficiencies, adapt to fisheries productivity changes, and proactively create effective transboundary institutions could lead to a future with higher profits and yields compared to what is produced today.
Future effects of climate change on ocean fisheries could be more than offset by management reforms for current fisheries.

  abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {Bycatch (the unintentional catch of non-target species or sizes) is consistently ranked as one of the greatest threats to marine fish populations; yet species-specific rates of bycatch survival are rarely considered in risk assessments. Regulations often require that bycatch of threatened species be released; but, if animals are already dead, their release serves no conservation purpose. We examined the survival of 12 shark species caught as bycatch in the US Atlantic pelagic longline fishery. Shark survival was evaluated in relation to fishery target (swordfish versus tuna) and four operational, environmental, and biological variables to evaluate the underlying mechanisms affecting mortality. Survival estimates ranged from 33\% (night shark) to 97\% (tiger shark) with seven of the 12 species being significantly affected by at least one variable. We placed our survival results within a framework that assessed each species' relative vulnerability by integrating survival estimates with reproductive potential and found that the bigeye thresher, dusky, night, and scalloped hammerhead shark exhibited the highest vulnerabilities to bycatch. We suggest that considering ecological and biological traits of species shows promise for designing effective conservation measures, whereas techniques that reduce fisheries interactions in the first place may be the best strategy for highly vulnerable species.},

Despite widespread recognition of this complexity conservationists possess a legacy of institutional structures, tools and practices better suited to simpler systems. We highlight two specific challenges posed by this mismatch: the difficulty of adaptive management where success is ambiguous and the tension between ``best practice'' and creativity. Drawing on research in other disciplines (including psychology, information systems, business management, and military strategy) we suggest practices that conservation could consider to better respond to complexity. These practices include, defining clear objectives, the use of scenarios, emphasis on pattern analysis, and ensuring greater scope for creative and decentralized decision making. To help illustrate these challenges and solutions, we point to parallels between conservation and military operations.},

  abstract = {Along the coast of Chile, fisheries targeting the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, commonly named ``loco'', were highly valuable until the end of the 80s when catches declined significantly. Since the late 90s, a management plan based on territorial-user-rights areas has been implemented, with limited effect on stock recovery. More effective loco conservation and management is impeded by lack of information regarding connectivity via larval dispersal between these individually-managed areas. To develop a regional view of loco connectivity, we integrate loco life history information into a biophysical, individual-based larval dispersal model. This model is used to evaluate scales of loco connectivity and seasonality in connectivity patterns, as well as to partition the coast into largely disconnected subpopulations using a recently developed connectivity-matrix clustering algorithm. We find mean dispersal distances ranging from 170 to 220 km depending on release depth of larvae and planktonic larval duration. Settlement success levels depend quantitatively on the physical and biological processes included in the model, but connectivity patterns remain qualitatively similar. Model estimates of settlement success peak for larval release dates in late austral autumn, consistent with field results and with favorable conditions for larval coastal retention due to weak upwelling during austral autumn. Despite the relatively homogeneous Chilean coastline, distinct subpopulations with minimal connectivity between them are readily identifiable. Barriers to connectivity that are robust to changes in model configuration exist at 23\textdegree{}S and 29\textdegree{}S latitudes. These zones are all associated with important headlands and embayments of the Chilean coast.},

Here we use an individual-based, biophysical model, to disentangle the effects of such factors, namely larval vertical migration, larval growth, larval mortality, adults fecundity, and habitat availability, for the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas (loco) in Chile. Lower transport success and higher dispersal distances are observed including larval vertical migration in the model. We find an overall decrease in larval transport success to settlement areas from northern to southern Chile. This spatial gradient results from the combination of current direction and intensity, seawater temperature, and available habitat. From our simulated connectivity patterns we then identify subpopulations of loco along the Chilean coast, which could serve as a basis for spatial management of this resource in the future.},

Strategies to reduce these impacts while addressing the growing need for food security (3) include increasing selectivity (1, 2): capturing species, sexes, and sizes in proportions that differ from their occurrence in the ecosystem. Increasing evidence suggests that more selective fishing neither maximizes production nor minimizes impacts (4\textendash{}7). Balanced harvesting would more effectively mitigate adverse ecological effects of fishing while supporting sustainable fisheries. This strategy, which challenges present management paradigms, distributes a moderate mortality from fishing across the widest possible range of species, stocks, and sizes in an ecosystem, in proportion to their natural productivity (8), so that the relative size and species composition is maintained.},

The rationale of this procedure is that the matrix eigenvectors of two similar samples would explain similar amounts of variance in the two samples.

Here, we use climate velocity trajectories3, together with information on thermal tolerances and habitat preferences, to project changes in global patterns of marine species richness and community composition under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways4 (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Our simple, intuitive approach emphasizes climate connectivity, and enables us to model over 12 times as many species as previous studies5,6. We find that range expansions prevail over contractions for both RCPs up to 2100, producing a net local increase in richness globally, and temporal changes in composition, driven by the redistribution rather than the loss of diversity. Conversely, widespread invasions homogenize present-day communities across multiple regions. High extirpation rates are expected regionally (for example, Indo-Pacific), particularly under RCP8.5, leading to strong decreases in richness and the anticipated formation of no-analogue communities where invasions are common. The spatial congruence of these patterns with contemporary human impacts7,8 highlights potential areas of future conservation concern. These results strongly suggest that the millennial stability of current global marine diversity patterns, against which conservation plans are assessed, will change rapidly over the course of the century in response to ocean warming.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Beverton\textendash{}Holt length-based mortality estimator has received widespread use primarily due to its applicability in data-limited situations. The mean length of animals that are fully vulnerable to the sampling gear can be used to estimate total mortality from basic growth parameters and a known length at first capture. This method requires equilibrium conditions because the mean length of a population will change only gradually after a change in mortality. In this study, we derive the transitional behavior of the mean length statistic for use in nonequilibrium conditions. We investigate conditions affecting the reliability of the Beverton\textendash{}Holt results and then develop a new procedure that allows a series of mortality rates to be estimated from mean length data representing nonequilibrium conditions in multiple years. We then examine an assessment of goosefish Lophius americanus that was criticized for its use of the Beverton\textendash{}Holt estimator under nonequilibrium conditions. Using data from the 1963\textendash{}2002 National Marine Fisheries Service annual fall groundfish surveys off the northeastern United States and assuming a single change in total mortality, we used the maximum likelihood method to estimate that the total mortality of goosefish in the southern assessment region increased from 0.31 to 0.60 per year in 1977. Estimates of the new mortality rate made three or more years after the change were relatively stable and only ranged from 0.55 to 0.71 per year, while estimates from the standard Beverton\textendash{}Holt approach ranged from 0.37 to 1.1 per year. The results for goosefish in the northern assessment region showed that total mortality changed from 0.14 to 0.29 per year in 1978 and then to 0.55 per year in 1987. The new nonequilibrium estimator allows a change in mortality to be characterized reliably several years faster than would occur with the use of the Beverton\textendash{}Holt estimator.},

Using Chile as a case study, we designed a market-based program aimed at improving fishers' livelihoods while incentivizing the establishment and enforcement of no-take areas within areas managed with territorial user right regimes. Building on explicit enabling conditions (i.e., high levels of governance, participation, and empowerment), we used a place-based, human-centered approach to design a program that will have the necessary support and buy-in from local fishers to result in landscape-scale biodiversity benefits. Transactional infrastructure must be complex enough to capture the biodiversity benefits being created, but simple enough so that the program can be scaled up and is attractive to potential financiers. Biodiversity benefits created must be commoditized, and desired behavioral changes must be verified within a transactional context. Demand must be generated for fisher-created biodiversity benefits in order to attract financing and to scale the market model. Important design decisions around these 3 components\textemdash{}supply, transactional infrastructure, and demand\textemdash{}must be made based on local social-ecological conditions. Our market model, which is being piloted in Chile, is a flexible foundation on which to base scalable opportunities to operationalize a scheme that incentivizes local, verifiable biodiversity benefits via conservation behaviors by fishers that could likely result in significant marine conservation gains and novel cross-sector alliances.

  abstract = {Marine reserves are areas of the sea where fishing is not allowed. They provide refuges where populations of exploited species can recover and habitats modified by fishing can regenerate. In some places, closed areas have been used for fisheries management for centuries [1] and, until recently, natural refugia also existed, inaccessible through depth, distance or adverse conditions. Developments in technology have left few areas of fishing interest beyond our reach. Recently, the idea of marine reserves as fisheries management tools has re-emerged with developing interest in ecosystem-based management, and observations of incidental fisheries benefits from reserves established for conservation. In light of new evidence, we argue that, by integrating large-scale networks of marine reserves into fishery management, we could reverse global fishery declines and provide urgently needed protection for marine species and their habitats.},

However, the global capacity for increased aquaculture production from the ocean and the relative productivity potential across countries are unknown. Here, we map the biological production potential for marine aquaculture across the globe using an innovative approach that draws from physiology, allometry and growth theory. Even after applying substantial constraints based on existing ocean uses and limitations, we find vast areas in nearly every coastal country that are suitable for aquaculture. The development potential far exceeds the space required to meet foreseeable seafood demand; indeed, the current total landings of all wild-capture fisheries could be produced using less than 0.015\% of the global ocean area. This analysis demonstrates that suitable space is unlikely to limit marine aquaculture development and highlights the role that other factors, such as economics and governance, play in shaping growth trajectories. We suggest that the vast amount of space suitable for marine aquaculture presents an opportunity for countries to develop aquaculture in a way that aligns with their economic, environmental and social objectives. Marine aquaculture has the potential to improve food security. A global analysis shows that space in coastal areas is unlikely to limit the potential for aquaculture.},

  abstract = {Sudden disruptions, or shocks, to food production can adversely impact access to and trade of food commodities. Seafood is the most traded food commodity and is globally important to human nutrition. The seafood production and trade system is exposed to a variety of disruptions including fishery collapses, natural disasters, oil spills, policy changes, and aquaculture disease outbreaks, aquafeed resource access and price spikes. The patterns and trends of these shocks to fisheries and aquaculture are poorly characterized and this limits the ability to generalize or predict responses to political, economic, and environmental changes. We applied a statistical shock detection approach to historic fisheries and aquaculture data to identify shocks over the period 1976\textendash{}2011. A complementary case study approach was used to identify possible key social and political dynamics related to these shocks. The lack of a trend in the frequency or magnitude of the identified shocks and the range of identified causes suggest shocks are a common feature of these systems which occur due to a variety, and often multiple and simultaneous, causes. Shocks occurred most frequently in the Caribbean and Central America, the Middle East and North Africa, and South America, while the largest magnitude shocks occurred in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Shocks also occurred more frequently in aquaculture systems than in capture systems, particularly in recent years. In response to shocks, countries tend to increase imports and experience decreases in supply. The specific combination of changes in trade and supply are context specific, which is highlighted through four case studies. Historical examples of shocks considered in this study can inform policy for responding to shocks and identify potential risks and opportunities to build resilience in the global food system.},

  abstract = {Global seafood trade nearly doubled in recent decades, fueled by decreasing transportation costs, advances in preservation and processing technologies, and open trade policies and is now among the most highly traded commodities (1). The United States is currently the world's top seafood importer and among the top five exporters (2). It is often quoted that 90\% of seafood consumed in the United States is imported, implying only 10\% is of domestic origin. Over the past decade, this statistic has been widely shared and highlighted with more than 60 news articles quoting it annually since 2014 ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1), and it is increasingly used to support proposed policy changes. In recent years, the former US Secretary of State, current US Secretary of Commerce, and members of Congress have all cited the number to call for new policy measures addressing seafood sustainability and dependence on foreign seafood (Fig. 1).

A better accounting of the globalized seafood supply chain will help support the US seafood industry, achieve sustainable production, and meet consumer demand. Image credit: Allison Horst (University of California, Santa Barbara, CA).

However, we argue that far more than 10\%, likely 35\textendash{}38\%, of seafood consumed in the United States is of domestic origin. Precise estimates are difficult because of complex supply chains: for instance, some seafood caught in the United States is exported for processing and imported again under a different trade code for consumption in the United States. Such globalized supply chains are commonplace with many products relying on numerous foreign inputs and crossing international borders multiple times. For example, beef production between the United States and Mexico can involve multiple exchanges of calves, adults, and final products (3). These counterintuitive patterns are created by low tariffs and transportation costs that allow producers to optimize for favorable interest rates \ldots{}

  abstract = {We synthesize results from existing models of marine reserves to identify key theoretical issues that appear to be well understood, as well as issues in need of further exploration. Models of marine reserves are relatively new in the scientific literature; 32 of the 34 theoretical papers we reviewed were published after 1990. These models have focused primarily on questions concerning fishery management at the expense of other objectives such as conservation, scientific understanding, recreation, education, and tourism. Roughly one-third of the models analyze effects on cohorts while the remaining models have some form of complete population dynamics. Few models explicitly include larval dispersal. In a fisheries context, the primary conclusion drawn by many of the complete population models is that reserves increase yield when populations would otherwise be overfished. A second conclusion, resulting primarily from single-cohort models, is that reserves will provide fewer benefits for species with greater adult rates of movement. Although some models are beginning to yield information on the spatial configurations of reserves required for populations with specific dispersal distances to persist, it remains an aspect of reserve design in need of further analysis. Other outstanding issues include the effects of (1) particular forms of density dependence, (2) multispecies interactions, (3) fisher behavior, and (4) effects of concentrated fishing on habitat. Model results indicate that marine reserves could play a beneficial role in the protection of marine systems against overfishing. Additional modeling and analysis will greatly improve prospects for a better understanding of the potential of marine reserves for conserving biodiversity.},

We show that life history characteristics and perturbation analysis can be used to predict changes in growth rate due to a decrease in adult mortality resulting from a marine reserve for different levels and types of dispersal.

Yet accurate mapping and tracking of fishing activities remain largely restricted to developed countries with sufficient resources to use automated identification systems and vessel monitoring systems. For many countries, the spatial extent and boundaries of fishing grounds are not completely known. We used satellite images at night to detect fishing grounds in the Philippines for fishing gears that use powerful lights to attract coastal pelagic fishes. We used nightly boat detection data, extracted by U.S. NOAA from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), for the Philippines from 2012 to 2016, covering 1713 nights, to examine spatio-temporal patterns of fishing activities in the country. Using density-based clustering, we identified 134 core fishing areas (CFAs) ranging in size from 6 to 23,215 km2 within the Philippines\&rsquo; contiguous maritime zone. The CFAs had different seasonal patterns and range of intensities in total light output, possibly reflecting differences in multi-gear and multi-species signatures of fishing activities in each fishing ground. Using maximum entropy modeling, we identified bathymetry and chlorophyll as the main environmental predictors of spatial occurrence of these CFAs when analyzed together, highlighting the multi-gear nature of the CFAs. Applications of the model to specific CFAs identified different environmental drivers of fishing distribution, coinciding with known oceanographic associations for a CFA\&rsquo;s dominant target species. This case study highlights nighttime satellite images as a useful source of spatial fishing effort information for fisheries, especially in Southeast Asia.},

Hence, the advantageous attributes of rights-based approaches from the perspective of one discipline may be quite different when seen from the perspective of another discipline. This is of concern as it exposes a tendency for particular disciplines to consider only the advantages of rights-based approaches, such as establishing a harvest cap, but to implicitly discount the disadvantages such as less attention being paid to critical ecological and ecosystem issues.},

  abstract = {While there has been a growing concern for the adverse ecological impacts of fishing, progress on incorporating these into operational fisheries management has been slow. Many fisheries management organizations have addressed the problem of overharvesting and over-capitalization first. In this domain, the question of access regulation has gained growing recognition as a key dimension of fisheries sustainability, leading to recommendation and progressive implementation of rights-based systems, in particular Individual Transferrable Quotas (ITQs). While adjustments in fishing capacity resulting from the implementation of these systems may entail a reduction in some unwanted ecosystem impacts of fishing, it is also recognized that they will not be sufficient to achieve the ecological outcomes increasingly demanded by the global community. There is thus a need to examine the possibilities for a common management framework for dealing with both over-capitalization of fisheries and adverse ecological effects of fishing. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of incorporating greater ecosystem goods and services into ITQ policy instruments initially designed with a narrow focus on commercial target species. We consider the advantages and limitations of alternative approaches in this respect and identify some of the practical issues associated with the different alternatives, in particular the underpinning knowledge requirements. We argue that given the need for increasingly streamlined management processes, further investigation into practical ways forward in this domain is crucial if management of fisheries is to achieve economic efficiency while fully encompassing the ecologically sustainable development objectives of ecosystem-based fisheries management.},

However, multivariate methods used to assess fish community structure and composition are sensitive to differences in the relative scale of indices or measures of abundance produced by different sampling methods. This makes combining data from different sampling gears and methods a serious challenge. We developed a method of combining catch per unit effort data that standardizes catch per unit effort data across gear types, which we call multigear mean standardization (MGMS). We evaluated how well MGMS and other types of standardization reflect underlying community structure through a computer simulation that generated model riverine-fish communities and simulated sampling data for two gears. In these simulations, combining sampling observations from two gears with MGMS produced community structure estimates that were highly correlated with true community structure under a variety of conditions that are common in large rivers..., Les {\'e}valuations de communaut{\'e}s de poissons reposent souvent sur un {\'e}chantillonnage fait avec diff{\'e}rents types d'engins.

  abstract = {Many rural and urban areas around the world are facing challenges to the supply of water. A key method of addressing water shortage is water conservation. The success of conservation measures depends on public support and behaviour change. While it is known that the public is generally supportive of water conservation measures, little is known about the dependence of water conservation attitudes and behaviour on geographical location and the water situation at specific locations. The present study investigates whether individual attitudes to water conservation, and reported participation in water conservation behaviours, differ between two Australian locations that vary significantly in their water situation. The first location, Darwin, is an urban location with a water surplus, whereas the second location, the Mallee in north-western Victoria, is a rural environment that has experienced an extended period of drought. Results indicate that there are significant differences in attitude and participation between the two areas. Significantly more people from the water-scarce location are supportive of most water conservation behaviours, and they are significantly more likely to state that they participate in water conservation behaviours. Implications for water policy are discussed.},

We developed a global database of management and fish population data (433 and 218 MPAs, respectively) to assess: MPA management processes; the effects of MPAs on fish populations; and relationships between management processes and ecological effects. Here we report that many MPAs failed to meet thresholds for effective and equitable management processes, with widespread shortfalls in staff and financial resources. Although 71\% of MPAs positively influenced fish populations, these conservation impacts were highly variable. Staff and budget capacity were the strongest predictors of conservation impact: MPAs with adequate staff capacity had ecological effects 2.9 times greater than MPAs with inadequate capacity. Thus, continued global expansion of MPAs without adequate investment in human and financial capacity is likely to lead to sub-optimal conservation outcomes.},

The ideal free distribution (IFD), from behavioral ecology, has proved useful for examining the relationship between vessel and resource distributions in commercial fisheries. When making inferences based upon the IFD it is critical to examine its underlying assumptions, particularly the form of competition between fishing vessels. When present, an IFD can decouple the relationship between local catch rates and abundance, obscuring declines in smaller or weaker fish stocks. As an alternative, probabilistic methods have also been successfully applied to the study of vessel behavior. However, parsimonious behavioral models like the IFD will often be preferable because (i) they can be examined using the data typically available from commercial fisheries, (ii) they require fewer data than probabilistic models, and (iii) they are easily incorporated in..., Depuis que la dynamique des flottes de p{\^e}che a {\'e}t{\'e} d{\'e}finie au cours des ann{\'e}es 1980, il s'est d{\'e}velopp{\'e} un int{\'e}r{\^e}t grandissant pour le r{\^o}le que joue le comportement des navires dans l'exploitation des ressources aquatiques.

Our analyses indicate that these isodars provide significantly better predictions than a simple IFD without costs. Autocorrelation in the catch and effort data necessitates the use of generalized linear least squares when estimating model parameters. Differences in costs that are proportional to effort are more clearly identified in the model than nonlinear effects, which may arise from extreme interference competition.

  abstract = {There has been a recent proliferation of large-scale marine protected areas (MPAs) containing pelagic habitats. These contribute substantially toward meeting the area-based goal of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 and to managing pelagic ecosystem pressures, including fishing. We assessed theoretical and empirical evidence for the achievement of ecological objectives by static and dynamic spatial management of pelagic fisheries. Exceptionally few studies have assessed ecological responses to MPAs that constrain pelagic fisheries, leaving substantial uncertainty over their efficacy. Assessments have provided a limited basis for causal inferences and have not evaluated whether other management tools would be more effective. Pelagic MPAs have relatively high promise to mitigate fisheries bycatch of species of conservation concern with ``slow'' life history traits and that form temporally and spatially predictable hotspots, and for some species, to protect habitats important for critical life history stages. It would be challenging to design MPAs to maintain absolute biomass levels of target stocks near targets and above limits: MPAs would need to be extensive to account for broad and variable distributions, and account for catch risk outside of the MPA, including from displaced fishing effort and fishing-the-line. For non-overexploited stocks, which is the status of most target pelagic species and their prey, there would likely be little response in absolute stock biomass to an MPA. While pelagic MPAs have a higher promise of increasing target stocks' local abundance, evidence with a robust basis for inferring causality is needed. Reducing fishing mortality of prey species might not affect the biomass of their pelagic predators because prey species experience light fishing pressure and because there may be a weak correlation between the absolute abundance of forage fish and their predators. There is an especially limited basis for predicting the effects of MPAs on fisheries-induced evolution (FIE) in pelagic species. We describe how pelagic MPAs could be designed to achieve five ecological objectives without causing cross-taxa conflicts and exacerbating FIE. To fill substantial gaps in knowledge, we prescribe counterfactual-based modeling of time series data of standardized catch records to infer causation in assessments of ecological responses to pelagic MPAs.},

  abstract = {Following an introduction to the broader context of the Symposium, the scope of the oral presentations is summarized under three themes: a global synthesis of fisheries impacts in different ecosystems; an overview of the methods available for quantifying ecosystem impacts; and the integration of fisheries and environmental management. The presentations generated substantial evidence that marine ecosystems have been impacted by fishing. Also there appeared to be a broad consensus that the present approach to achieving conservation objectives of fisheries management does not sufficiently take into account ecosystem considerations. There was not, however, a consensus on what additional restrictions are required, or on what features of ecosystems need to be protected. A way forward is to add ecosystem objectives to the conservation component of fisheries management plans, as well as to the management plans for other ocean-use sectors. The aggregate ocean-use activities would need to be evaluated in a nested manner, at a range of geographic scales, in relation to the more broadly defined conservation objectives. It is suggested that the geographic scales for evaluation of ecosystem considerations could be defined in a pragmatic manner based on the somewhat artificial boundaries of political and administrative systems already in place. The six conservation objectives proposed are maintenance of (1) ecosystem diversity, (2) species diversity, (3) genetic variability within species, (4) directly impacted species, (5) ecologically dependent species, and (6) trophic level balance. Indicators for each objective are discussed, as well as reference points that would trigger management actions. Such a broadening of conservation objectives for fisheries mangement would require both enhanced monitoring and a greater workload added to the process of provision of scientific advice through peer review. Of equal importance would be the challenges of establishing a governance framework to address multiple uses of marine resources. The spirit of the Symposium was that these coupled scientific and governance challenges will be very stimulating.},

Using nonlinear forecasting models, we analysed over 200 time series of survey abundance and landings from two distinct ecosystems for patterns of dynamic complexity (dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics) and predictability. Differences in system dimensionality and nonlinear dynamics were associated with time series that reflected human intervention via fishing effort, implying the coupling between human and natural systems generated dynamics distinct from those detected in the natural resource subsystem alone. Estimated dimensionality was highest for landings and higher in abundance indices of unfished species than fished species. Fished species were more likely to display nonlinear dynamics than unfished species, and landings were significantly less predictable than abundance indices. Results were robust to variation in life history characteristics. Dynamics were predictable over a 1-year time horizon in seventy percent of time series, but predictability declined exponentially over a 5-year horizon. The ability to make predictions in fisheries systems is therefore extremely limited. To our knowledge, this is the first cross-system comparative study, and the first at the scale of individual species, to analyse empirically the dynamic complexity observed in fisheries data and to quantify predictability broadly. We outline one application of short-term forecasts to a precautionary approach to fisheries management that could improve how uncertainty and forecast error are incorporated into assessment through catch limit buffers.},

Tag-integrated models offer a promising approach for incorporating spatial structure and movement patterns in stock assessments, but the complexity of the framework makes implementation challenging and the appraisal of performance difficult. A flounder-like fishery was simulated to emulate the metapopulation dynamics of the three yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) stocks off New England, and the robustness of spatially explicit tag-integrated models were compared with closed population assessments. Different movement parametrizations and data uncertainty scenarios were simulated, while the ability of the tag-integrated model to estimate reporting rate and time-varying movement were also evaluated. Results indicated that the tag-integrated framework was robust for the simulated fishery across a wide range of connectivity levels and that tag reporting rates were accurately estimated. Closed population models also demonstrated limited error. Therefore, spatially explicit approaches may not always be warranted even when regional connectivity is occurring, but tag-integrated models can provide improved parameter estimates when reliable tagging data are available. Tag-integrated models also serve as valuable tools for informing spatially explicit operating models, which can then be used to evaluate the assumptions and performance of closed population models.},

Biomass is thought to be more sensitive than abundance and length, while the wariness of fishes is emerging as a new metric. Periodically harvested closures (PHCs) that involve the opening and closing of an area to fishing are the most common form of fisheries management in the western Pacific. The opening of PHCs to fishing provides a unique opportunity to compare the sensitivity of metrics, such as abundance, length, biomass and wariness, to changes in fishing pressure. Diver-operated stereo video (stereo-DOV) provides data on fish behavior (using a proxy for wariness, minimum approach distance) simultaneous to abundance and length estimates. We assessed the impact of PHC protection and harvesting on the abundance, length, biomass, and wariness of target species using stereo-DOVs. This allowed a comparison of the sensitivity of these metrics to changes in fishing pressure across four PHCs in Fiji, where spearfishing and fish drives are common. Before PHCs were opened to fishing they consistently decreased the wariness of targeted species but were less likely to increase abundance, length, or biomass. Pulse harvesting of PHCs resulted in a rapid increase in the wariness of fishes but inconsistent impacts across the other metrics. Our results suggest that fish wariness is the most sensitive indicator of fishing pressure, followed by biomass, length, and abundance. The collection of behavioral data simultaneously with abundance, length, and biomass estimates using stereo-DOVs offers a cost-effective indicator of protection or rapid increases in fishing pressure. Stereo-DOVs can rapidly provide large amounts of behavioral data from monitoring programs historically focused on estimating abundance and length of fishes, which is not feasible with visual methods.},

We studied sites along a watershed gradient to examine both the physical environment and the associated biological communities. Transplanted corals showed no differences in growth rates and mortality along the watershed gradient. However, coral cover, coral richness, and coral colony density increased with increasing distance from the mouth of the bay. There was a negative relationship between coral cover and mean suspended solids concentration. Negative relationships were also found between terrigenous sedimentation rates and the richness of adult and juvenile corals. These results have major implications not only for Pacific islands but for all countries with reef systems downstream of rivers. Land development very often leads to increases in river runoff and suspended solids concentrations that reduce coral cover and coral diversity on adjacent reefs.},

  abstract = {* The inherent complexity of nature produces a diverse and varied set of outcomes for any given ecological process. However, the advance of ecology requires making generalizations that synthesize current knowledge and guide new basic research and practical applications. Among the synthesis tools available for this specific purpose, meta-analysis is one of the most accurate and powerful methods.

* This Special Feature examines the use that meta-analysis has received in plant ecology over the last two decades and provides examples of synthesis applied to contemporary topics in different areas of plant ecology from populations to ecosystems.

* The number of meta-analyses in plant ecology has been increasing rapidly in the last two decades. However, this increase has not been accompanied by a parallel increase in quality. The opening review paper in this Special Feature provides a checklist of quality criteria specific to ecological meta-analysis that will largely contribute to improvement of the methodological and reporting standards of meta-analyses.

* The following five papers in the Special Feature demonstrate the advantages of application of meta-analysis compared with other techniques of research synthesis. Meta-analysis is applied here to demonstrate the consistency of ecological hypotheses across large spatial scales (e.g. Janzen-Connell hypothesis), understand sources of variation in the magnitude of ecological processes (e.g. herbivory effects on leaf life span, effects of intraspecific genetic diversity on communities and ecosystems), measure synergistic impacts of environmental change drivers (e.g. CO2, drought, land use) or assess research gaps within a certain sub-discipline of plant ecology (e.g. landscape fragmentation).

* Synthesis. Meta-analysis can contribute to the advance of ecological theory by synthesizing the available evidence on specific topics and informing the scope of generalizations. However, plant ecologists can only take full advantage of this capacity if we improve our knowledge on how and when to conduct a proper meta-analysis, and by avoiding the frequent misuses that have characterized the use of this statistical tool in the ecological literature thus far.},

This paper develops a simple theoretical model of self-financing vessel buybacks to examine equilibrium outcomes using sequential versus take-it-or-leave-it auctions, and financing schemes which allocate costs either homogeneously or according to rents captured through the buyback. This model demonstrates that programs which spread costs evenly among remaining vessels limit the possible extent of buybacks, as do programs which buy vessels one at a time in sequence rather than all at once. In addition to the theoretical modeling, a stylized case study inspired by the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Fishery is also provided. This analysis suggests that a wide range of auction structures could roughly half the size of the existing fleet, and starkly demonstrates how information poor settings can entirely derail a buyback.},

Using firm-level data from the fishery 2 years before private harvesting rights were introduced, the year they were implemented, and 3 years afterward, a stochastic frontier is estimated to test for changes in technical, allocative, and economic efficiency. The study indicates that (1) the short-run efficiency gains from privatization may take several years to materialize and can be compromised by restrictions on transferability, duration, and divisibility of the property right; (2) substantial long-run gains in efficiency can be jeopardized by preexisting regulations and the bundling of the property right to the capital stock; and (3) the gains from privatization are not just in terms of cost efficiency but include important benefits in revenue and product form.},

By using methods not previously applied in the fisheries conservation context, we show in four disparate fisheries (including the long-lived and slow-growing orange roughy) that the dynamic maximum economic yield (MEY), the biomass that produces the largest discounted economic profits from fishing, exceeds MSY. Thus, although it is theoretically possible that maximizing discounted economic profits may cause stock depletions, our results show there is a win-win: In many fisheries at reasonable discount rates and at current prices and costs, larger fish stocks increase economic profits. An MEY target that exceeds MSY and transfers from higher, future profits to compensate fishers for the transition costs of stock rebuilding would help overcome a key cause of fisheries overexploitation, industry opposition to lower harvests.
Profits from fisheries are maximized at population sizes larger than those that produce a sustainable yield, suggesting a way to counter industry opposition to lower harvests.

The profits\textendash{}employment trade-off of adopting a BMEY target vs. a traditional BMSY target is calculated using a model and data from the Western and Central Pacific tuna fisheries (WCPTF), while a generic bioeconomic model is constructed to show numerical values of BMEY from including processing and/or retail sectors and the consumer benefits of harvesting fish. For the WCPTF, results show that the long-term gains per job lost from pursuing a BMEY target are worth several times the value of the average GDP per capita of Pacific Island Countries. The generic bioeconomic model shows that including a processing and/or retail sector, as well as measures of consumer benefit, lowers the BMEY target. However, there remains a broad range of parameter values for which BMEY is still greater than biomass at maximum sustainable yield, or BMSY. The paper also illustrates cases where BMEY~{$>~$}BMSY at different values of the price elasticity of demand, margins for processing and/or retail sectors and values of the discount rate.},

Previous studies often have lacked detailed dietary information on major predators, and have often been confounded by differences in habitat complexity between reserve and fished sites. This study investigates the effects of marine reserve protection on predator-prey interactions of coral reef fish on the inshore islands of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The abundance of species of prey fish of Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae), a piscivore and the major target of the hook and line fisheries on the GBR, were estimated in protected and fished zones. These prey species were identified from previous detailed studies of the diet of P. leopardus. Fish populations and habitat characteristics were surveyed by underwater visual census. Previous studies had determined that the biomass of P. leopardus was 3\textendash{}4 times higher in protected than fished zones in the Whitsunday and Palm Islands, central GBR, after 14 years of protection. Eight of the nine prey species had a higher density within fished zones than protected zones, six significantly so. The density of all prey fish was twice that in the fished than the protected zone (p {$<$} 0.001). There were no significant differences in availability of different sized refuge holes, structural complexity or live coral cover between zones. Thus, important attributes of habitat complexity did not confound the comparisons between reserve and fished zones. Finally, a significant negative correlation (r = 0.46) between coral trout biomass and summed prey fish biomass suggested that predation may be an important structuring process in this system. The results have implications for the conservation of fishery targets and their prey. The study highlights the potential ecosystem implications of the use of no-take marine reserves as conservation and fisheries management tools.},

Both the slope and the mid-point height of the relationship can be compared at different fishing intensities. Here, we develop size-spectra for reef fish assemblages using body size- abundance data collected by underwater visual census in each of ten fishing grounds across a known gradient of fishing intensity in the Kadavu Island group, Fiji. Slopes of the size-spectra became steeper (F9,69=3.20, p{$<$}0.01) and the height declined (F9,69=15.78, p{$<$}0.001) with increasing fishing intensity. Regressions of numbers of individuals per size class across grounds were negative for all size classes, although the slope was almost zero for the smallest size class. Response to exploitation of each size class category was greatest for larger fish. Steepening of the slope with increasing fishing intensity largely resulted from reductions in the relative abundance of large fish and not from the ecological release of small fish following depletion of their predators. The slope and height of the size-spectrum appear to be good indicators of fishing effects on reef fish assemblages.},

  abstract = {Study aim and location

Many populations of highly mobile marine fishes, including large sharks, are experiencing declines. The benefits of spatial management zones, such as marine protected areas (MPAs), for such animals are unclear. To help fill this knowledge gap, we examined core habitat use areas (CHUAs) for bull (Carcharhinus leucas), great hammerhead (Sphyrna mokarran) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in relation to specific MPAs and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the western North Atlantic Ocean.

Methods

Bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks (N~=~86 total) were satellite tagged and tracked in southern Florida and the northern Bahamas between 2010 and 2013. Filtered and regularized positions from Argos locations of tag transmissions were used to generate CHUAs for these sharks. Overlaps of CHUAs with regional protected areas and exclusive economic management zones were quantified to determine the proportion of each tracked shark's CHUA under spatial protection from exploitation.

Results

A total of 0\%, 17.9\% and 34.7\% of the regional CHUAs for tracked bull, great hammerhead and tiger sharks, respectively, were fully protected from exploitation in the study area.

Main conclusions

Expansion of protected areas to include U.S. territorial waters would effectively protect 100\% of the CHUAs for all tracked sharks in the study area. This finding is particularly significant for great hammerhead sharks, which are currently overfished, vulnerable to bycatch mortality and are the focus of strident regional conservation efforts. These findings also provide a means to inform decision makers and marine conservation planning efforts as to the types of management actions available and potential efficacy of spatial protections for these marine predators.},

  abstract = {Aim

Many important patterns and processes vary across the phylogeny and depend on phylogenetic scale. Nonetheless, phylogenetic scale has never been formally conceptualized, and its potential remains largely unexplored. Here, we formalize the concept of phylogenetic scale, review how phylogenetic scale has been considered across multiple fields and provide practical guidelines for the use of phylogenetic scale to address a range of biological questions.

Innovation

We summarize how phylogenetic scale has been treated in macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography and macroecology, illustrating how it can inform, and possibly resolve, some of the longstanding controversies in these fields. To promote the concept empirically, we define phylogenetic grain and extent, scale dependence, scaling and the domains of phylogenetic scale. We illustrate how existing phylogenetic data and statistical tools can be used to investigate the effects of scale on a variety of well-known patterns and processes, including diversification rates, community structure, niche conservatism or species-abundance distributions.

Main conclusions

Explicit consideration of phylogenetic scale can provide new and more complete insight into many longstanding questions across multiple fields (macroevolution, community ecology, biogeography and macroecology). Building on the existing resources and isolated efforts across fields, future research centred on phylogenetic scale might enrich our understanding of the processes that together, but over different scales, shape the diversity of life.},

Our review identifies patterns of distributional concerns surrounding property rights; many of the same groups that opposed limits on entry and fish traps also oppose ITQs. We provide examples of how political opposition to ITQs is mollified by modifications in program design, although these design compromises may have efficiency costs. We conclude by pointing to the need for more research on equity-efficiency trade-offs and for greater attention to fishermen heterogeneity in economic analysis.},

We show that, in the presence of skill heterogeneity, some current users (namely those with the highest skill) may prefer common-pool management, despite large aggregate increases in rents due to rationalization. Whether the transition to property rights is Pareto improving hinges critically on the initial allocation of rights, because inframarginal rents may be lower under property rights than limited entry.

Coastal ecosystems, which lie at the interface between marine and terrestrial ecosystems and provide an array of ecosystem services to different groups, aptly illustrate these challenges. Successful ecosystem-based management of coastal ecosystems requires incorporating scientific information and the knowledge and views of interested parties into the decision-making process. Estimating the provision of ecosystem services under alternative management schemes offers a systematic way to incorporate biogeophysical and socioeconomic information and the views of individuals and groups in the policy and management process. Employing ecosystem services as a common language to improve the process of ecosystem-based management presents both benefits and difficulties. Benefits include a transparent method for assessing trade-offs associated with management alternatives, a common set of facts and common currency on which to base negotiations, and improved communication among groups with competing interests or differing worldviews. Yet challenges to this approach remain, including predicting how human interventions will affect ecosystems, how such changes will affect the provision of ecosystem services, and how changes in service provision will affect the welfare of different groups in society. In a case study from Puget Sound, Washington, we illustrate the potential of applying ecosystem services as a common language for ecosystem-based management.},

New approaches to simulating the complex interaction effects of multiple human impacts on the marine environment. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi.10.1093/icesjms/fst196. The interplay of anthropogenic effects presents significant challenges to modelling and managing marine resources. The increasing awareness of the complexity of the interaction of human impacts has led to a demand for end-to-end (E2E) models that attempt to include all major processes in a single framework. These whole-of-system models are potentially very useful as numerical laboratories to explore the potential spectrum of responses from the interplay of anthropogenic effects. However, despite their limitations and early stage of development, the output of E2E models is under increasing social pressure to provide ``simple'' answers to highly complex problems. Here, we suggest some approaches that can be included in E2E models for considering the potential effects of complex interactions on community and ecosystem services. We show how assumptions and parameterizations made in existing E2E models can be altered to allow processes to shift with the dynamic response to both natural and human drivers. Alternative ways for interpreting complex model output, non-linearity, handling uncertainty, and how to include multispecies interaction effects within a framework of ecosystem-based management are suggested. We point out parts of the marine system that have been neglected in model development, but now should be included to understand interaction effects from multiple anthropogenic stressors. The E2E model framework also needs to be further expanded from an often-skewed focus on ecological systems to a more even-handed treatment of socio-ecological systems, including cultural aspects. Future progress in E2E models will require an interdisciplinary framework involving both qualitative and quantitative approaches, closer cooperation between empiricists and modellers, and the development of consistent terminology.},

  abstract = {Each modeller who builds and analyses an individual-based model learns of course a great deal, but what has ecology as a whole learned from the individual-based models published during the last decade? Answering this question proves extremely difficult as there is no common motivation behind individual-based models. The distinction is introduced between `pragmatic' motivation, which uses the individual-based approach as a tool without any reference to the theoretical issues which have emerged from the classical state variable approach and `paradigmatic' motivation, which explicitly refers to theoretical ecology. A mini-review of 50 individual-based animal population models shows that the majority are driven by pragmatic motivation. Most models are very complex and special techniques to cope with this complexity during their analysis are only occasionally applied. It is suggested that in order to orient individual-based modelling more towards general theoretical issues, we need increased explicit reference to theoretical ecology and an advanced strategy for building and analysing individual-based models. To this end, a heuristic list of rules is presented which may help us to advance the practice of individual-based modelling and to learn more general lessons from individual-based modelling in the future than we have during the last decade. The main ideas behind these rules are as follows: (1) Individual-based models usually make more realistic assumptions than state variable models, but it should not be forgotten that the aim of individual-based modelling is not `realism' but modelling. (2) The individual-based approach is a bottom-up approach which starts with the `parts' (i.e. individuals) of a system (i.e. population) and then tries to understand how the system's properties emerge from the interaction among these parts. However, bottom-up approaches alone will never lead to theories at the systems level. State variable or top-down approaches are needed to provide an appropriate integrated view, i.e. the relevant questions at the population level.},

However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

  abstract = {Biological information collected during a 4-year experimental trap-fishery for Palinurus delagoae off South Africa was used to estimate growth rates, size at sexual maturity, and natural mortality. These parameters, together with an estimate of total mortality and catch-at-length information from the trap-fishery and a crustacean trawl fishery in the same region, were used in a deterministic length-based cohort analysis to estimate fishing mortality and recruitment, and to assess the impact of the two fisheries on the resource. The impact of both trap and trawl fisheries is greatest on immature and small mature lobsters (60 mm\&lt;CL\&lt;69 mm). Over-fishing on this component of the population (by traps and trawls) and on the adult component (by traps) have led to a rapid decrease in catches (down from 89.5 to 7.4 t per year for traps, and from {$\sim$}33 to 10 t per year for trawls) and in catch rates, between 1994 and 1997. A length-based Thompson and Bell model suggests that a combined catch of {$\sim$}60 t per year may have been sustainable at the average effort level exerted over the 4-year study period, and that the spawning biomass would then have been reduced to {$\sim$}29\% of pristine. Given the small predicted yield from this resource and the high mortality of small lobsters, fisheries managers opted for a single fishery. The trawl fishery was selected, based on higher annual earnings, a lower economic risk, and an established infrastructure in the region. An ecologically beneficial spin-off from selecting the trawl fishery is that rocky areas are inaccessible to trawl nets, resulting in natural refuges for lobsters against fishing.},

Networks of marine protected areas (MPAs) provide an option for increasing the ecological and economic benefits often provided by single MPAs. It is vital to empirically assess the effects of MPA networks and to prioritize the monitoring data necessary to explain those effects. We summarize the types of MPA networks based on their intended management outcomes and illustrate a framework for evaluating whether a connectivity network is providing an outcome greater than the sum of individual MPA effects. We use an analysis of an MPA network in Hawai'i to compare networked MPAs to non-networked MPAs to demonstrate results consistent with a network effect. We assert that planning processes for MPA networks should identify their intended outcomes while also employing coupled field monitoring-simulation modeling approaches, a powerful way to prioritize the most relevant monitoring data for empirically assessing MPA network performance.},

Procrustes target rotation is introduced here as a key method for refining previously available MC tests. The proposed modification helps reduce the risk of type-I errors, and it is shown to improve the test's discriminating power. The reliability of the proposed methodology is examined in an idealized setting for a cluster of harmonic oscillators immersed in red noise. Furthermore, the common method of data compression into a few leading principal components, prior to M-SSA, is reexamined, and its possibly negative effects are discussed. Finally, the generalized Procrustes test is applied to the analysis of interannual variability in the North Atlantic's sea surface temperature and sea level pressure fields. The results of this analysis provide further evidence for shared mechanisms of variability between the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Oscillation in the interannual frequency band.},

These same conflicts exist in the ocean; however, they are mostly regarded in a region- or taxa-specific context despite evidence that human-wildlife conflict is prevalent across the global oceans and likely to increase as a result of successful conservation measures. Can the lessons learned from conflicts on land promote more sustainable success in the sea? Or, do ocean human-wildlife conflicts create unique challenges that require new solutions? This paper synthesizes evidence from human-wildlife conflicts in the ocean and provides initial suggestions for progressing with effective management in the ocean. Humans have extensive experience managing conflict with terrestrial predators and several of the strategies are transferable to marine predators, but several important differences between systems necessitate a marine-specific focus and evaluation of existing mitigation strategies. Further, in managing marine wildlife conflict, it is crucial to recognize that perceived conflicts can be just as important as actual conflict and that, in many cases, human-human conflict is at the root of human-wildlife conflict. As efforts to recover important predator populations continue, humans are faced with the exciting opportunity and a new necessity to constructively manage these recoveries to continue to meet goals for marine conservation while simultaneously promoting human safety and industry in the seas.},

Despite extensive evidence that cascading trophic interactions can underlie community-wide recovery inside no-take marine reserves by protecting high-level predators, the spatial extent of these effects into adjacent fished areas is unknown. I examined the potential for community-wide changes (i.e., the transition from overgrazed coralline barrens to macroalgal beds) in temperate rocky reefs within and around a no-take marine reserve. For this purpose I assessed distribution patterns of predatory fishes, sea urchins, and barrens across the reserve boundaries. Predatory fishes were significantly more abundant within the reserve than in adjacent locations, with moderate spillover across the reserve edges. In contrast, community-wide changes of benthic assemblages were apparent well beyond the reserve boundaries, which is consistent with temporary movements of predatory fishes (e.g., foraging migration) from the reserve to surrounding areas. My results suggest that no-take marine reserves can promote community-wide changes beyond their boundaries.},

Here we introduce a series of papers prepared within the framework of an international workshop entitled: Advances in GLMs/GAMs modeling: from species distribution to environmental management, held in Riederalp, Switzerland, 6\textendash{}11 August 2001.We first discuss some general uses of statistical models in ecology, as well as provide a short review of several key examples of the use of GLMs and GAMs in ecological modeling efforts. We next present an overview of GLMs and GAMs, and discuss some of their related statistics used for predictor selection, model diagnostics, and evaluation. Included is a discussion of several new approaches applicable to GLMs and GAMs, such as ridge regression, an alternative to stepwise selection of predictors, and methods for the identification of interactions by a combined use of regression trees and several other approaches. We close with an overview of the papers and how we feel they advance our understanding of their application to ecological modeling.},

  abstract = {Protected areas are currently the primary strategy employed worldwide to maintain ecosystem services and mitigate biodiversity loss. Despite the prevalence and planned expansion of protected areas, the impact of this conservation tool on human communities remains hotly contested in conservation policy. The social impacts of protected areas are poorly understood largely because previous evaluations have tended to focus on one or very few outcomes, and few have had the requisite data to assess causal effects (i.e. longitudinal data for protected and control sites). Here, we evaluated the short-, medium- and long-term impacts of marine protected areas (MPAs) that were specifically designed to achieve the dual goals of conservation and poverty alleviation (hereafter ``integrated MPAs''), on three key domains of poverty (security, opportunity and empowerment) in eight villages in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using social data for villages with and without integrated MPAs from pre-, mid- and post-the five-year implementation period of the integrated MPAs, we found that the integrated MPAs appeared to contribute to poverty alleviation. Positive impacts spanned all three poverty domains, but within each domain the magnitude of the effects and timescales over which they manifested were mixed. Importantly, positive impacts appeared to occur mostly during the implementation period, after which integrated MPA activities all but ceased and reductions in poverty did not continue to accrue. This finding questions the efficiency of the short-term approach taken in many international donor-assisted protected area projects that integrate development and conservation, which are often designed with the expectation that project activities will be sustained and related benefits will continue to accumulate after external support is terminated.},

The study investigates this in the context of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Zanzibar, Tanzania, and in particular the Memba Island \textendash{} Chwaka Bay Marine Conservation Area (MIMCA). This is done by applying Pretty's typology of participation in addressing procedural justice, which is according to Paavola linked to distributive justice, i.e. the just distribution of costs and benefits. How does participation in MIMCA facilitate procedural and distributive justice? To answer this question a number of fishermen, women seaweed farmers, local leaders, and representatives of the private sector were interviewed (n=136) in five villages. Interviews were also made with government officials at relevant departments. The results show that Village Fishermen Committees were participating in the implementation of MIMCA but not in its planning phase. Participation was mainly in the form of manipulative and passive participation. Other local actors did not participate at all. Instead, the government assumed that justice was achieved by distributing equipment, alternative income generating projects, and relying on tourism for local development. However, the distributed equipment and tourism development have created conflict and injustice within and between villages, because of the insufficient resources which did not target those in need. Tourism created problems such as inequality between livelihoods, environmental destruction and local power asymmetries between hotel management and local people. The MIMCA top-down intervention has not increased participation or justice, nor has it achieved sustainable resource use and conflict resolution. It is suggested that interactive participation by all local actors is needed to create just trade-offs. Justice needs to be explicitly addressed for integrated conservation and development projects to achieve sustainability.},

  abstract = {One billion people depend on seafood as their primary source of protein and 25\% of the world's total animal protein comes from fisheries. Yet a third of fish stocks worldwide are overexploited or depleted. Using individual case studies, many have argued that community-based co-management should prevent the tragedy of the commons because cooperative management by fishers, managers and scientists often results in sustainable fisheries. However, general and multidisciplinary evaluations of co-management regimes and the conditions for social, economic and ecological success within such regimes are lacking. Here we examine 130 co-managed fisheries in a wide range of countries with different degrees of development, ecosystems, fishing sectors and type of resources. We identified strong leadership as the most important attribute contributing to success, followed by individual or community quotas, social cohesion and protected areas. Less important conditions included enforcement mechanisms, long-term management policies and life history of the resources. Fisheries were most successful when at least eight co-management attributes were present, showing a strong positive relationship between the number of these attributes and success, owing to redundancy in management regulations. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of prominent community leaders and robust social capital, combined with clear incentives through catch shares and conservation benefits derived from protected areas, for successfully managing aquatic resources and securing the livelihoods of communities depending on them. Our study offers hope that co-management, the only realistic solution for the majority of the world's fisheries, can solve many of the problems facing global fisheries.},

  abstract = {Sedentary or low-mobility organisms show a high degree of dependency with their substrate, where its heterogeneity often determines small-scale spatial patterns of distribution, life history traits, and fishery yields. For sea urchins, this spatial structure is usually shaped by food availability, habitat structure, individual movement, and fishery dynamics. All of these have a significant impact on their physiological and reproductive status and in particular on their gonadal content. These patterns are of particular interest considering that the sea urchin fishery is a roe fishery where marketability depends on gonad yield and quality, which in turn is related to spatial and temporal variations in associated kelp beds. Thus, better gonad quality and yields generate higher profits for both fishers (divers) and processors. However, competition among divers within a non-cooperative system creates a ``race for shellfish'' precluding higher gonad yields per unit of effort. A spatially explicit agent-based model for the San Diego, California red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) fishery was developed in order to assess the benefits of cooperative harvesting by depicting spatial and temporal variations in fishery yields. A cooperative harvesting scenario where divers consistently target those areas with higher yields avoiding low-quality sea urchins was compared against a non-cooperative situation where divers harvest at random or based only on densities of sea urchins. Sea urchin population at the end of the simulation period was 20\% higher for the most cooperative scenario compared to the non-cooperative fishery. Further, for the most cooperative scenario where information sharing among divers is greatest and harvest is coordinated, sea urchin catches were at least 10\% higher and gonad yield 35\% higher than in the non-cooperative scenario. In this model, information sharing and organized harvesting typical of well-functioning cooperatives allowed fishers to optimize the use of the resource in terms of higher gonad yields per unit of effort while maintaining the productivity of the stock. This study also highlights the importance of community-based management (i.e., collaborative efforts in assessment, management, and governance of fisheries between fishers, scientists, and managers) toward improving fisheries sustainability.},

Bias-correction methods have been developed, but they often require previous knowledge of selectivity pattern, capture\textendash{}recapture data or intensive age-growth sampling over multiple consecutive years. When corrective measures are not feasible, investigators have attempted a number of biologically based procedures to reduce this bias. We evaluated several existing biologically based procedures that could potentially remove bias from growth parameter estimates. We built an age and length structured population model and tested the utility of four procedures to remove bias: 1) fixing t0 at zero, 2) deleting data associated with ages that are not fully vulnerable to sampling, 3) deleting less than fully vulnerable ages and fixing t0 at zero, and 4) fixing L{$\infty$} at the maximum value observed in the data. We considered sampling gears that had no size selectivity, asymptotic selectivity, and dome-shaped selectivity patterns for all procedures. Results suggested that none of these procedures would eliminate bias in growth parameters across all three gear selectivity patterns. Investigators should attempt to use methods to correct growth parameters for size selectivity of sampling gears (e.g., mark recapture methods). If such corrections are not feasible, prior information about the size selectivity pattern of sampling gears is necessary for informed selection of biologically based von Bertalanffy fitting procedures.},

It is highly relevant to ask if costs and benefits of such interventions are allocated equitably, and if the distribution of payments is dependent on a policy's socio-political context. Literature speaks of distributive and contextual equity here, but evidence on how these two dimensions are interlinked is scarce. Thus, our study investigates Vietnam's Payments for Forest Environmental Services scheme and assesses its implementation's cost benefit-allocation at the local level. Pre-existing political, economic, and social conditions are examined for their impact on current payment distribution. The study takes a qualitative case study approach with semi-structured in-depth interviews with local, provincial, and national respondents focusing on the district of Nam {\DJ}{\^o}ng. Findings reveal that various gains were distributed unevenly among individuals. While some community members benefitted from privileged positions in local hierarchies, others were excluded from participation and from tapping into funds. Such results hint to the functional importance of equity for incentive-based resource management. They demonstrate that environmental policies can reinforce existing asymmetries in power and wealth if they do not consider the socio-political context they operate in.},

An interesting but hitherto largely underexplored corollary of this fact is that Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques make it practical to consider broader classes of informative priors than have been used previously. Conjugate priors, long the workhorse of classic methods for eliciting informative priors, have their roots in a time when modern computational methods were unavailable. In the current environment more attractive alternatives are practicable. A reappraisal of these classic approaches is undertaken, and principles for generating modern elicitation methods are described. A new prior elicitation methodology in accord with these principles is then presented.},

Available data and research show that, for countries most dependent on fish to meet the nutritional requirements of their population, wild capture fisheries remain the dominant supplier. Although, contrary to popular narratives, the sustainability of these fisheries is not always and everywhere in crisis, securing their sustainability is essential and requires considerable effort across a broad spectrum of fishery systems. An impediment to achieving this is that the current research and policy discourses on environmental sustainability of fisheries and food security remain only loosely and superficially linked. Overcoming this requires adoption of a broader sustainability science paradigm to help harness synergies and negotiate tradeoffs between food security, resource conservation, and macroeconomic development goals. The way society chooses to govern fisheries is, however, an ethical choice, not just a technical one, and we recommend adding an ethical dimension to sustainability science as applied to fisheries.},

The present paper reviews the assumptions, explicit and implicit, that underlay the calculations of benefits expected from enacting these regulations. It is concluded that there are sufficient uncertainties about these assumptions to make realization of the anticipated benefits doubtful. Actions to eliminate large-scale wastage caused by discarding of unmarketable fish, as taken by the international commissions in the 1950s, still appear justifiable. However, applying the doctrine of letting most fish spawn at least once to protect spawning stocks is not an appropriate basis for size at first capture regulation when exploitation rate can be controlled.},

Conservation organizations seeking to reduce over-fishing and promote better fishing practices have increasingly turned to market-basefid mechanisms such as environmental sustainability labels (eco-labels) in order to shift patterns of household consumption. This paper presents an analysis of consumer response to an advisory for sustainable seafood adopted by a regional supermarket in the United States. The advisory consisted of a label in which one of three traffic light colors was placed on each fresh seafood product to inform consumers about its relative environmental sustainability. Green meant ``best'' choice, yellow meant ``proceed with caution,'' and red meant ``worst choice''. Using a unique product-level panel scanner data set of weekly sales and taking advantage of the random phase-in of the advisory by the retailer, we apply a difference-in-differences identification strategy to estimate the effect of the advisory on overall seafood sales as well as the heterogeneous impact of the advisory by label color and whether the seafood met additional health-related criteria. We find evidence that the advisory led to a statistically significant 15.3\% decline in overall seafood sales, a statistically significant 34.9\% decline in the sale of yellow labeled seafood, and a statistically significant 41.3\% decline in the sale of yellow labeled seafood on a mercury safe list. We find no statistically significant difference in sales of green or red labeled seafood.},

Here we review 112 independent measurements of 80 reserves to show that the higher average values of density, biomass, average organism size, and diversity inside reserves (relative to controls) reach mean levels within a short (1\textendash{}3~y) period of time and that the values are subsequently consistent across reserves of all ages (up to 40~y).

  abstract = {Recent interest in using marine reserves for marine resource management and conservation has largely been driven by the hope that reserves might counteract declines in fish populations and protect the biodiversity of the seas. However, the creation of reserves has led to dissension from some interested groups, such as fishermen, who fear that reserves will do more harm than good. These perceived differences in the effect of marine reserves on various stakeholder interests has led to a contentious debate over their merit. We argue here that recent findings in marine ecology suggest that this debate is largely unnecessary, and that a single general design of a network of reserves of moderate size and variable spacing can meet the needs and goals of most stakeholders interested in marine resources.},

  abstract = {Marine reserves are quickly gaining popularity as a management option for marine conservation, fisheries, and other human uses of the oceans. Despite the popularity of marine reserves as a management tool, few reserves appear to have been created or designed with an understanding of how reserves affect biological factors or how reserves can be designed to meet biological goals more effectively (e.g., attaining sustainable fish populations). This shortcoming occurs in part because the many studies that have examined the impacts of reserves on marine organisms remain isolated examples or anecdotes; the results of these many studies have not yet been synthesized. Here, I review the empirical work and discuss the theoretical literature to assess the impacts of marine reserves on several biological measures (density, biomass, size of organisms, and diversity), paying particular attention to the role reserve size has in determining those impacts. The results of 89 separate studies show that, on average, with the exception of invertebrate biomass and size, values for all four biological measures are significantly higher inside reserves compared to outside (or after reserve establishment vs. before) when evaluated for both the overall communities and by each functional group within these communities (carnivorous fishes, herbivorous fishes, planktivorous fishes/invertebrate eaters, and invertebrates). Surprisingly, results also show that the relative impacts of reserves, such as the proportional differences in density or biomass, are independent of reserve size, suggesting that the effects of marine reserves increase directly rather than proportionally with the size of a reserve. However, equal relative differences in biological measures between small and large reserves nearly always translate into greater absolute differences for larger reserves, and so larger reserves may be necessary to meet the goals set for marine reserves. The quality of the data in the reviewed studies varied greatly. To improve data quality in the future, whenever possible, studies should take measurements before and after the creation of a reserve, replicate sampling, and include a suite of representative species. Despite the variable quality of the data, the results from this review suggest that nearly any marine habitat can benefit from the implementation of a reserve. Success of a marine reserve, however, will always be judged against the expectations for that reserve, and so we must keep in mind the goals of a reserve in its design, management, and evaluation.},

  abstract = {Marine reserves affect areas outside reserve boundaries via the displacement of fishing effort and the export of production. Here we focus on how these key factors interact to influence the results seen once reserves are created. For a settlement-limited fishery, export of increased production from within reserves can offset the effects of displaced fishing effort. We develop simple mathematical models that indicate net fisheries benefits can accrue at closures up to and perhaps beyond 50\% of total stock area through the export of production, given documented average increases in biomass within reserves. However, reserve monitoring programs face problems identifying independent control sites because the spatial extent of export is unknown. Efforts to monitor reserve impacts on recruitment are further complicated by the fact that large reserve closures are likely necessary before significant changes in recruitment can be detected above normal interannual fluctuations. Resolving these limitations requires comprehensive monitoring data before reserves are implemented. Fortunately, studies of reserves that used Before\textendash{}After, Control\textendash{} Impact (BACI) experimental designs show that control and reserve sites were equivalent prior to protection, and that control sites improved after reserves were in place. Consequently, any bias in our current perception of reserve impacts likely underestimates their effect.},

Managing and conserving these systems in the face of uncertainty remains a daunting challenge, particularly with respect to developing networks of marine reserves. Here we review several modelling frameworks that explicitly acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty, and then use these methods to evaluate reserve spacing rules given increasing levels of uncertainty about larval dispersal distances. Our approach finds similar spacing rules as have been proposed elsewhere \textendash{} roughly 20\textendash{}200~km \textendash{} but highlights several advantages provided by uncertainty modelling over more traditional approaches to developing these estimates. In particular, we argue that uncertainty modelling can allow for (1) an evaluation of the risk associated with any decision based on the assumed uncertainty; (2) a method for quantifying the costs and benefits of reducing uncertainty; and (3) a useful tool for communicating to stakeholders the challenges in managing highly uncertain systems. We also argue that incorporating rather than avoiding uncertainty will increase the chances of successfully achieving conservation and management goals.},

A shift towards a more comprehensive management of these activities, as with recent emphasis on ecosystem-based approaches to management, requires a means for evaluating their interactive and cumulative impacts. Here we develop a framework for this evaluation, focusing on five core concepts: (1) activities have interactive and cumulative impacts, (2) management decisions require consideration of, and tradeoffs among, all ecosystem services, (3) not all stressors are equal or have impacts that increase linearly, (4) management must account for the different scales of activities and impacts, and (5) some externalities cannot be controlled locally but must be accounted for in marine spatial planning. Comprehensive ocean zoning provides a powerful tool with which these key concepts are collectively addressed.},

Despite considerable empirical evidence that abundance and biomass of fished species increase within marine reserve boundaries, the potential for reserves to provide fisheries and conservation benefits to adjacent waters remains heavily debated. This paper uses statistical and population models to evaluate published empirical data on adult spillover from marine reserves and shows that spillover is a common phenomenon for species that respond positively to reserve protection, but at relatively small scales, detectable on average up to 800 m from reserve boundaries. At these small scales, local fisheries around reserves were likely unsustainable in 12 of 14 cases without the reserve, and spillover partially or fully offsets losses in catch due to reserve closure in the other two cases. For reserves to play a role in sustaining and replenishing larger-scale fished stocks, networks of reserves may be necessary, but as few exist this is difficult to evaluate. The results suggest reserves can simultaneously meet conservation objectives and benefit local fisheries adjacent to their boundaries.},

In the cases when connections are acknowledged, there is often little assessment of if or how well MPAs can achieve specific EBM goals. Here we start by critically evaluating commonalities and differences between MPAs and EBM. Next, we use global analyses to show where and how much no-take marine reserves can be expected to contribute to EBM goals, specifically by reducing the cumulative impacts of stressors on ocean ecosystems. These analyses revealed large stretches of coastal oceans where reserves can play a major role in reducing cumulative impacts and thus improving overall ocean condition, at the same time highlighting the limitations of marine reserves as a single tool to achieve comprehensive EBM. Ultimately, better synergies between these two burgeoning approaches provide opportunities to greatly benefit ocean health.},

However, despite widespread recognition of the importance that equitable distribution of benefits or costs across society can play in conservation success, little formal theory exists for how to explicitly incorporate equity into conservation planning and prioritization. Here, we develop that theory and implement it for three very different case studies in California (United States), Raja Ampat (Indonesia), and the wider Coral Triangle region (Southeast Asia). We show that equity tends to trade off nonlinearly with the potential to achieve conservation objectives, such that similar conservation outcomes can be possible with greater equity, to a point. However, these case studies also produce a range of trade-off typologies between equity and conservation, depending on how one defines and measures social equity, including direct (linear) and no trade-off. Important gaps remain in our understanding, most notably how equity influences probability of conservation success, in turn affecting the actual ability to achieve conservation objectives.

Here we present results from five years of annual global assessment for 220 countries and territories, evaluating potential drivers and consequences of changes and presenting lessons learned about the challenges of using composite indicators to measure sustainability goals. Globally scores have shown little change, as would be expected. However, individual countries have seen notable increases or declines due in particular to improvements in the harvest and management of wild-caught fisheries, the creation of marine protected areas (MPAs), and decreases in natural product harvest. Rapid loss of sea ice and the consequent reduction of coastal protection from that sea ice was also responsible for declines in overall ocean health in many Arctic and sub-Arctic countries. The OHI performed reasonably well at predicting near-term future scores for many of the ten goals measured, but data gaps and limitations hindered these predictions for many other goals. Ultimately, all indicators face the substantial challenge of informing policy for progress toward broad goals and objectives with insufficient monitoring and assessment data. If countries and the global community hope to achieve and maintain healthy oceans, we will need to dedicate significant resources to measuring what we are trying to manage.},

There is a growing need for scientific guidance in the design of network-wide monitoring programs to evaluate the efficacy of reserves at meeting their conservation and management goals. Here, we present an evaluation of the Channel Islands reserve network, which was established in 2003 off the coast of southern California. This reserve network spans a major environmental and biogeographic gradient, making it a challenge to assess network-wide responses of many species. Using fish community structure data from a long-term, large-scale monitoring program, we first identified persistent geographic patterns of community structure and the scale at which sites should be grouped for analysis. Fish communities differed most among islands with densities of individual species varying from 3- to 250-fold. Habitat structure differed among islands but not based on reserve status. Across the network, we found that, after 5 years, species targeted by fishing had higher densities (1.5\texttimes{}) and biomass (1.8\texttimes{}) inside reserves, whereas nontargeted species showed no significant differences. Examining trophic groups, piscivore and carnivore biomass was significantly greater inside reserves (1.8\texttimes{} and 1.3\texttimes{} more, respectively), whereas the biomass of planktivores and herbivores was similar inside and out. A framework for incorporating biogeographic variation into reserve network assessments is critical as we move from the evaluation of single reserves to networks of reserves.},

  abstract = {Bolbometopon muricatum, the largest species of parrotfish, is a functionally important species that is characterised by the formation of aggregations for foraging, reproductive, and sleeping behaviours. Aggregations are restricted to shallow reef habitats, the locations of which are often known to local fishers. Bolbometopon muricatum fisheries are therefore vulnerable to overfishing and are likely to exhibit hyperstability, the maintenance of high catch per unit effort (CPUE) while population abundance declines. In this study, we provide a clear demonstration of hyperstable dynamics in a commercial B. muricatum fishery in Isabel Province, Solomon Islands. Initially, we used participatory mapping to demarcate the Kia fishing grounds into nine zones that had experienced different historic levels of fishing pressure. We then conducted comprehensive underwater visual census (UVC) and CPUE surveys across these zones over a 21-month period in 2012\textendash{}2013. The individual sites for replicate UVC surveys were selected using a generalised random tessellation stratified variable probability design, while CPUE surveys involved trained provincial fisheries officers and local spearfishers. A comparison of fishery-independent abundance data and fishery-dependent CPUE data indicate extreme hyperstability, with CPUE maintained as B. muricatum abundance declines towards zero. Hyperstability may explain the sudden collapses of many B. muricatum spear fisheries across the Pacific and highlights the limitations of using data-poor fisheries assessment methods to evaluate the status of commercially valuable coral reef fishes that form predicable aggregations.},

  abstract = {The Western and Central Pacific Ocean is home to the world's most productive tuna fisheries, with the majority of tuna catches occurring inside the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the region's developing coastal States. It is important that these fisheries are managed effectively throughout their range, both within and between EEZs and on the high seas. Unrestrained exploitation in a particular EEZ or on the high seas has the potential to significantly impact on catches elsewhere with potentially devastating consequences for developing coastal States, some of which have few alternate resources. The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) was established in 2004 to manage the region's highly migratory tuna fisheries. However, the WCPFC has since repeatedly failed to adopt conservation and management measures that are sufficient to meet the WCPFC's conservation and sustainable use objectives. This paper analyses catch data from the WCPFC and suggests that the weak position of bigeye (in a strategic political context), the unwillingness of members to compromise their interests and the lack of a transparent framework for distributing the burden of conservation are key factors in the WCPFC's failure to adopt sufficiently strong conservation and management measures.},

Climate change could therefore result in species range dynamics that reduce the relevance of current fixed protected areas in future conservation strategies. Here, we apply species distribution modeling and conservation planning tools in three regions (Mexico, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, and Western Europe) to examine the need for additional protected areas in light of anticipated species range shifts caused by climate change. We set species representation targets and assessed the area required to meet those targets in the present and in the future, under a moderate climate change scenario. Our findings indicate that protected areas can be an important conservation strategy in such a scenario, and that early action may be both more effective and less costly than inaction or delayed action. According to our projections, costs may vary among regions and none of the three areas studied will fully meet all conservation targets, even under a moderate climate change scenario. This suggests that limiting climate change is an essential complement to adding protected areas for conservation of biodiversity.},

Pioneering work in the late 1980s recognized the potential implications of shifting species range boundaries for static protected areas. Many early recommendations for protected area design were general, emphasizing larger protected areas, buffer zones, and connectivity between reserves. There were limited practical tests of these suggestions. Development of modeling and conservation planning methods in the 1990s allowed more rigorous testing of concepts of reserve and connectivity function in a changing climate. These studies have shown decreasing species representation in existing reserves due to climate change, and the ability of new protected areas to help slow loss of representation in mid-century scenarios. Connectivity on protected area periphery seems more effective than corridors linking protected areas. However, corridors serving other purposes, such as large carnivore movement, may be useful for accommodating species range shifts as well. Assisted migration and ex situ management strategies to complement protected areas are being explored. Finally, in scenarios of the latter half of the century, protected areas and connectivity become increasingly expensive and decreasingly effective, indicating the importance of reducing human-induced climate change.},

However, the fisheries benefits of FPAs are not well understood, particularly for indiscriminate fisheries typical of tropical systems. Here we report the results of a model that tests the fisheries effects of no-take protected areas in conditions unique to indiscriminate riverine/floodplain systems. The model has a generalized form applicable to a wide range of systems. We report the results of the general model, as well as those from a specialized form parameterized for the Tonle Sap lake, Cambodia. Both the general and Tonle Sap versions of the model show that FPAs can pay important fisheries benefits, especially where it is difficult to control fishing mortality through gear restrictions or other means. The harvest and profit benefit response curves have similar shapes, with additional FPAs paying high dividends at less than approximately 50\% FPA coverage, and then truncating and declining thereafter. In the specific setting of the Tonle Sap of Cambodia, FPAs would pay a large increase in harvest because current FPA coverage is low. It may be counterintuitive to community fisheries managers in Cambodia that the best way to increase harvest is to restrict fishing, but at very high levels of fishing effort, reducing effort or area fished will improve both harvest and profit. In Cambodia, it may make sense to maximize harvest rather than profit because fishers living in poverty need to maximize protein offtake, but the benefits of FPAs remain. Similar considerations may apply in many freshwater and indiscriminate fisheries.},

The risk of extinction is shown to be high without stock-dependent unit cost of fish, and to get a viable Nash-Cournot equilibrium the major player's share must be well above one half.

The prevalence of small farms in the 1930s limited private solutions for controlling the downwind externalities associated with wind erosion. Drifting sand from unprotected fields damaged neighboring farms. Small farmers cultivated more of their land and were less likely to invest in erosion control than were larger farmers. Soil Conservation Districts, established by government after 1937, helped coordinate erosion control. This unitized' solution for collective action is similar to that used in other natural resource/environmental settings.},

The target tuna catch and length compositions and bycatch amounts were analyzed from more than 50,000 purse seine sets sampled by onboard observers who had, in addition to collecting sampling data on species and size composition of target tunas in the catch, and set-level estimates of total bycatch, also identified the sets as either ``associated'' or ``unassociated''. Classification tree (CT) models were developed based on 2007\textendash{}2011 observer data and tested for misclassification error rates on 2012 data. Two types of model misclassification errors (MCE) are possible: unassociated sets misclassified as associated (termed false positive or Type I) and associated sets misclassified as unassociated sets (false negative or Type II error). A third error measure, overall MCE, is a weighted average of Type I and Type II errors. The classification rules developed on the basis of observer catch sampling tended to be nearly presence/absence, e.g. greater than 99\% skipjack composition or presence of 0.5 kg rainbow runner, likely keyed by the modest observer sample sizes. Overall MCE rates were 21.8\% for the initial tuna-only CT model and 14.4\% for the bycatch-included model. The improvement in overall classification for the bycatch models derived principally from a reduction in Type I errors. The addition of auxiliary non-sampling variables (e.g., longitude, month) and use of more complex resampling extensions to CT modelling led to little to no improvement in MCE rates. We employed our methodology to analyze a particular subset of the purse seine data, i.e., sets from the FAD-closure periods of 2009\textendash{}12. The intent was to determine if MCE rates of these particular sets were greater than the MCE rates found in the more general analysis. Reassuringly, the MCE rates of sets during the FAD closure period were found to be equal, or even a bit lower than MCE rates in the broader analyses based on our best performing model.},

Indirect evidence of fish spillover could be obtained by horizontal gradients in fish abundance. To address this question, the existence of gradients of fish abundance and biomass across marine reserve boundaries was assessed in six Mediterranean MPAs using underwater visual censuses performed at various distances from the core of the MPA, in integral reserve (IR), to buffer zone (BZ) and fished areas. A reserve effect was evidenced with higher values of fish species richness (\texttimes{}1.1), abundance (\texttimes{}1.3), and biomass (\texttimes{}4.7) recorded inside MPAs compared to adjacent fished areas. Linear correlations revealed significant negative gradients in mean fish biomass in all the reserves studied after the effect of habitat had been removed, whereas negative gradients in abundance were less conspicuous. Generalized additive models suggested two main patterns of biomass gradients, with a sharp decrease at the IR\textendash{}BZ boundary or at the BZ\textendash{}fished area boundary. It was estimated that fish spillover beneficial to local fisheries occurred mostly at a small spatial scale (100s of metres). The existence of regular patterns of negative fish biomass gradients from within MPAs to fished areas was consistent with the hypothesis of adult fish biomass spillover processes from marine reserves and could be considered as a general pattern in this Mediterranean region.},

  abstract = {The wildlife trade involves thousands of vertebrate species and now rivals habitat loss as an extinction driver in some regions. However, its impacts are poorly known because field monitoring of wild populations is expensive, localized, and requires specialized expertise. We examined whether market data and expert opinion could be used to identify bird species that may be at risk from the trade in Indonesia. We asked expert ornithologists to characterize population trends of 38 species of Indonesian birds, including many heavily traded species. They identified 14 species as having undergone population declines, all of which are regularly traded, and only two of which are restricted to old-growth forests. Conversely, none of the untraded species was classified as declining. We combined the expert-derived population trends with data on changes in price and trade volume from Indonesian wildlife markets to see if market data could identify declining species. We found that severely declining species have a significantly different price\textendash{}volume signal than stable/increasing species; the former are characterized by increasing market prices and declining volumes. Market data are much cheaper to collect than field data, roughly 1/30th the cost of a representative field study. We recommend a two-step approach to assess trade impacts on wild birds in Southeast Asia: coordinated market monitoring followed by field studies of species whose market signals indicate declining populations. Our findings, however, require further validation with higher resolution wild population and market data.},

Marine reserves, areas closed to all forms of fishing, continue to be advocated and implemented to supplement fisheries and conserve populations [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, although the reproductive potential of important fishery species can dramatically increase inside reserves [5, 6, 7, 8], the extent to which larval offspring are exported and the relative contribution of reserves to recruitment in fished and protected populations are unknown [4, 9, 10, 11]. Using genetic parentage analyses, we resolve patterns of larval dispersal for two species of exploited coral reef fish within a network of marine reserves on the Great Barrier Reef. In~a~1,000~km2 study area, populations resident in three reserves exported 83\% (coral trout, Plectropomus maculatus) and 55\% (stripey snapper, Lutjanus carponotatus) of assigned offspring to fished reefs, with the remainder having recruited to natal reserves or other reserves in the region. We estimate that reserves, which account for just 28\% of the local reef area, produced approximately half of all juvenile recruitment to both reserve and fished reefs within 30~km. Our results provide compelling evidence that adequately protected reserve networks can make a significant contribution to the replenishment of populations on both reserve and fished reefs at a scale that benefits local stakeholders.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

I reviewed bomb carbon dating (n~=~15) and fluorochrome chemical marking (n~=~44) age validation studies to investigate the frequency and magnitude of this phenomenon. Age was likely to have been underestimated in nine of 29 genera and 30\% of the 53 populations studied, including 50\% of those validated using bomb carbon dating. Length and age were strongly significant predictors of occurrence, with age typically underestimated in larger and older individuals. These characteristics suggest age underestimation is likely a systemic issue associated with the current methods and structures used for ageing. Where detected using bomb carbon dating, growth zones were reliable up to 88\% of asymptotic length (L{$\infty$}) and 41\% of maximum age (AMax). The maximum magnitude of age underestimation, {$\Delta$}Max, ranged from five to 34~years, averaging 18~years across species. Current perceptions of shark and ray life histories are informed to a large extent by growth studies that assume calcified ageing structures are valid throughout life. The widespread age underestimation documented here shows this assumption is frequently violated, with potentially important consequences for conservation and management. In addition to leading to an underestimation of longevity, the apparent loss of population age-structure associated with it may unexpectedly bias growth and mortality parameters. Awareness of these biases is essential given shark and ray population assessments often rely exclusively on life history parameters derived from ageing studies.},

We initially demonstrate that, since populations in reserve systems can be sustained either by covering a minimal fraction of the coast with small reserves or by covering a smaller fraction of the coast with few large reserves, cost considerations dictate that the conservation goal would be best met by reserves as large as practically possible. In contrast, the fisheries goal of maximizing yield requires maximizing larval export outside of reserves, which we show means that reserves should be as small as practically possible. Meeting the fisheries goal is ultimately more costly because it suggests a larger area of the coastline should be in reserves, but it also improves on conservation goals by enhancing sustainability for species dispersing longer distances.},

  abstract = {Management of the diverse fisheries of the world has had mixed success. While managing single species in data-rich environments has been largely effective, perhaps the greatest challenge facing fishery managers is how to deal with mixed stocks of fish with a range of life histories that reside in the same location. Because many fishing gears are nonselective, and the costs of making gear selective can be high, a particular problem is bycatch of weak stocks. This problem is most severe when the weak stock is long-lived and has low fecundity and thus requires a very long recovery time once overfished. We investigate the role that marine reserves might play in solving this challenging and ubiquitous problem in ecosystem-based management. Evidence for marine reserves' potential to manage fisheries in an ecosystem context has been mixed, so we develop a heuristic strategic mathematical model to obtain general conclusions about the merits of managing multispecies fisheries by using reserves relative to managing them with nonspatial approaches. We show that for many fisheries, yields of strong stocks can be increased, and persistence of weak stocks can be ensured, by using marine reserves rather than by using traditional nonspatial approaches alone. Thus, reserves have a distinct advantage as a management tool in many of the most critical multispecies settings. We also show how the West Coast groundfish fishery of the United States meets these conditions, suggesting that management by reserves may be a superior option in that case.},

Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDMuch of ecological theory and the understanding of ecological systems has been based on the idea that the observed states and dynamics of ecological systems can be represented by stable asymptotic behavior of models describing these systems. Beginning with early work by Lotka and Volterra through the seminal work of May in the 1970s, this view has dominated much of ecological thinking, although concepts such as the idea of tipping points in ecological systems have played an increasingly important role. In contrast to the implied long time scales of asymptotic behavior in mathematical models, both observations of ecological systems and questions related to the management of ecological systems are typically focused on relatively short time scales.A number of models and observations demonstrate possible transient behavior that may persist over very long time periods, followed by rapid changes in dynamics. In these examples, focusing solely on the long-term behavior of systems would be misleading. A long transient is a persistent dynamical regime\textemdash{}including near-constant dynamics, cyclic dynamics, or even apparently chaotic dynamics\textemdash{}that persists for more than a few and as many as tens of generations, but which is not the stable long-term dynamic that would eventually occur. These examples have demonstrated the potential importance of transients but have often appeared to be a set of idiosyncratic cases. What is needed is an organized approach that describes when a transient behavior is likely to appear, predicts what factors enhance long transients, and describes the characteristics of this transient behavior. A theory of long ecological transients is a counterpart to the related question of tipping points, where previous work based on an analysis of simple bifurcations has provided broad insights.
ADVANCESJust as ideas based on the saddle-node bifurcation provide a basis for understanding tipping points, a suite of ideas from dynamical systems provides a way to organize a systematic study of transient dynamics in ecological systems. As illustrated in the figure, a relatively small number of ideas from dynamical systems are used to categorize the different ways that transients can arise. Translating these abstract results from dynamical systems into observations about both ecological models and ecological system dynamics, it is possible to understand when transients are likely to occur and the various properties of these transients, with implications for ecosystem management and basic ecological theory. Transients can provide an explanation for observed regime shifts that does not depend on underlying environmental changes. Systems that continually change rapidly between different long-lasting dynamics, such as insect outbreaks, may most usefully be viewed using the framework of long transients.An initial focus on conceptual systems, such as two-species systems, establishes the ubiquity of transients and an understanding of what ecological aspects can lead to transients, including the presence of multiple time scales and particular nonlinear interactions. The influences of stochasticity and more realistic higher-dimensional dynamics are shown to increase the likelihood, and possibly the temporal extent, of transient dynamics.
OUTLOOKThe development of such a framework for organizing the study of transients in ecological systems opens up a number of avenues for future research and application. The approach we describe also raises important questions for further development in dynamical systems. We have not, for example, emphasized nonautonomous systems, which may be required to understand the implications of a changing environment for transients. Systems with explicit time dependence as well as stochastic nonlinear systems still present great mathematical challenges.Implications for management and basic ecological understanding depend on both the results we describe and future developments. A recognition of the difficulty of prediction caused by long transients, and of the corresponding need to match dynamics to transient behaviors of models, shows that basing either management or interpretation of ecological observations only on long-term dynamics can be seriously flawed. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6406/eaat6412/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Two ways that long transients arise in ecology, illustrated as a ball rolling downhill.(A) Slow transition away from a ghost attractor: a state that is not an equilibrium, but would be under slightly different conditions. (B) Lingering near a saddle: a state that is attracting from some directions but repelling from others. Additional factors such as stochasticity, multiple time scales, and high system dimension can extend transients.
The importance of transient dynamics in ecological systems and in the models that describe them has become increasingly recognized. However, previous work has typically treated each instance of these dynamics separately. We review both empirical examples and model systems, and outline a classification of transient dynamics based on ideas and concepts from dynamical systems theory. This classification provides ways to understand the likelihood of transients for particular systems, and to guide investigations to determine the timing of sudden switches in dynamics and other characteristics of transients. Implications for both management and underlying ecological theories emerge.},

This pervasive pattern implies that the structure of the biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy at higher biomass. Similar exponents are obtained for community production-biomass relations, suggesting conserved links between ecosystem structure and function. These exponents are similar to many body mass allometries, and yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently from individual-level scaling, which is not fully understood. These patterns suggest a greater degree of ecosystem-level organization than previously recognized and a more predictive approach to ecological theory.
INTRODUCTION A surprisingly general pattern at very large scales casts light on the link between ecosystem structure and function. We show a robust scaling law that emerges uniquely at the level of whole ecosystems and is conserved across terrestrial and aquatic biomes worldwide. This pattern describes the changing structure and productivity of the predator-prey biomass pyramid, which represents the biomass of communities at different levels of the food chain. Scaling exponents of the relation between predator versus prey biomass and community production versus biomass are often near {$\frac{3}{4}$}, which indicates that very different communities of species exhibit similar high-level structure and function. This recurrent community growth pattern is remarkably similar to individual growth patterns and may hint at a basic process that reemerges across levels of organization.
RATIONALE We assembled a global data set for community biomass and production across 2260 large mammal, invertebrate, plant, and plankton communities. These data reveal two ecosystem-level power law scaling relations: (i) predator biomass versus prey biomass, which indicates how the biomass pyramid changes shape, and (ii) community production versus community biomass, which indicates how per capita productivity changes at a given level in the pyramid. Both relations span a wide range of ecosystems along large-scale biomass gradients. These relations can be linked theoretically to show how pyramid shape depends on flux rates into and out of predator-prey communities. In order to link community-level patterns to individual processes, we examined community size structure and, particularly, how the mean body mass of a community relates to its biomass.
RESULTS Across ecosystems globally, pyramid structure becomes consistently more bottom-heavy, and per capita production declines with increasing biomass. These two ecosystem-level patterns both follow power laws with near {$\frac{3}{4}$} exponents and are shown to be robust to different methods and assumptions. These structural and functional relations are linked theoretically, suggesting that a common community-growth pattern influences predator-prey interactions and underpins pyramid shape. Several of these patterns are highly regular (R2 {$>$} 0.80) and yet are unexpected from classic theories or from empirical relations at the population or individual level. By examining community size structure, we show these patterns emerge distinctly at the ecosystem level and independently from individual near {$\frac{3}{4}$} body-mass allometries.
CONCLUSION Systematic changes in biomass and production across trophic communities link fundamental aspects of ecosystem structure and function. The striking similarities that are observed across different kinds of systems imply a process that does not depend on system details. The regularity of many of these relations allows large-scale predictions and suggests high-level organization. This community-level growth pattern suggests a systematic form of density-dependent growth and is intriguing given the parallels it exhibits to growth scaling at the individual level, both of which independently follow near {$\frac{3}{4}$} exponents. Although we can make ecosystem-level predictions from individual-level data, we have yet to fully understand this similarity, which may offer insight into growth processes in physiology and ecology across the tree of life.

A general scaling law for ecology
Despite the huge diversity of ecological communities, they can have unexpected patterns in common. Hatton et al. describe a general scaling law that relates total predator and prey biomass in terrestrial and aquatic animal communities (see the Perspective by Cebrian). They draw on data from many thousands of population counts of animal communities ranging from plankton to large mammals, across a wide range of biomes. They find a ubiquitous pattern of biomass scaling, which may suggest an underlying organization in ecosystems. It seems that communities follow systematic changes in structure and dynamics across environmental gradients.

Although the International Law of the Sea granted Pacific island countries the right to exploit and manage this valuable fishery, they have been unable to prevent resource decline or to capture economic development potential from their intersections with the global tuna industry. Variants of neoliberalism identify Pacific island countries' weak institutions to explain these failings. We argue that this explanation is insufficient. As an alternative, we offer a political economy analysis of the co-evolution of fisheries regulation and the strategies of the Japanese and Taiwanese fleets (and their governments) in the region. This framing illustrates the relational, multi-scalar processes within and among states and firms that shape patterns in the sector. Our findings indicate that the combination of competitive capital accumulation strategies and inter-state power relations must be addressed to explain challenges in the WCPO tuna sector.},

  abstract = {The tuna industry in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) is one of the largest and most valuable fisheries in the world. Since the 1980s, Pacific island countries have used licensing agreements with foreign fishing interests\textemdash{}known as access agreements\textemdash{}to earn tuna-related revenue and control the environmental impacts of fishing, with only minimal success. To date, there has been little work detailing the structure of access agreements and assessing how this structure relates to economic and environmental outcomes in the sector. This article helps to fill this gap by providing an overview of various access structures and a detailed empirical assessment of how these structures are applied in access agreements between Pacific island countries and the major foreign fishing interests active in the WCPO. This analysis is placed in the context of evolving regional fisheries management structures. The study reveals that while there is no uniform formula for access agreements, each structure is subject to distinct political, economic and environmental considerations that influence outcomes for Pacific island countries. As Pacific island countries develop the mechanism to allocate fishing rights under the new Vessel Day Scheme, drawing on their long history with access agreements will assist efforts to use access to achieve policy objectives. Improved transparency will enable Pacific island countries to identify successes and problems and adapt the Vessel Day Scheme allocation mechanisms accordingly.},

  abstract = {Defining, strengthening and enforcing rights over fisheries resources is frequently identified as central to overcoming `the tragedy of the commons' and associated environmental and economic challenges in fisheries systems. Though economic theory generally suggests that output control (e.g. quotas) creates the strongest incentives for efficiency and conservation, input controls (e.g. on effort) remain common. This paper explores the rationale for, and implications of, employing a transferable effort scheme in one of the largest and most valuable fisheries. In 2007, eight Pacific Island countries implemented the Vessel Day Scheme with the aims of strengthening their rights over tuna resources and control over economic and environmental trends. Four years since implementation, the scheme has significantly increased economic returns for the island states and generated improvements in data reporting. However, it has not generated a firm limit on fishing effort and its structure has made it difficult to directly target the biological concerns of individual species within the multi-species fishery. In the future, outcomes of the Vessel Day Scheme will continue to be tempered by the structural limitations of effort-based regulatory scheme, market conditions in the sector and the willingness of firms and island states to clarify, abide by and enforce the technical components of the scheme.},

  abstract = {Age and size at first reproduction have broad implications for studying population and community ecology. From general functions of body growth we developed models for estimating both age and size at first reproduction when growth trajectories are the only reliable information. We evaluated our models using empirical data, including 85 species of marine and freshwater fishes, with 235 populations or sex groups. From the data set, we found the following two sets of relations. (1) There is a nonlinear negative relation between the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient (K) and the age at first reproduction (Tr). (2) The ratio of body length at first reproduction (Lr) to asymptotic body length (Linf) may increase in two possible ways: one is increases in K and, consequently, decreases in Linf; the other is increases in Tr and delay of the age at first reproduction. Our model integrates the above complex relations into a simple linear function. The set of life-history invariants summarized by E. Charnov and by A. L. Jensen is a special case of our model. The pattern of life-history diversification demonstrated by K. O. Winemiller and K. A. Rose is similar to our model implication and the results of our data analysis. Additional information about other complex traits such as mortality and fecundity are not needed in our models, so our models provide an independent basis for testing life-history theories and for applying those theories to modeling population dynamics.},

  abstract = {Age estimates are often used as conditional age-at-length (CAAL) data in stock assessment models to internally estimate growth and other life history parameters of fish populations. Obtaining sufficient numbers of age estimates is not a trivial task, as it requires considerable sampling effort, the development of aging criteria, the validation of age observations, and, finally, the production aging of sufficient numbers of age structures to inform the assessment models. In this study, we evaluated the influence of CAAL data in several assessment models of West Coast groundfish, by both randomly selecting only portions of available CAAL data and by selecting intermittent numbers of years of CAAL data for inclusion in models. These sensitivity tests were conducted on recent stock assessment models for Blackgill Rockfish (Sebastes melanostomus), Bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis), and Pacific Sanddab (Citharichthys sordidus), as these three species represent a fairly wide range of life history types. The results showed that for the Bocaccio model, the assessment outputs from model runs with reduced numbers of CAAL data were very comparable with the model run with all available data. However, when CAAL data were reduced, the Blackgill and Sanddab models estimated different spawning outputs, stock depletions, and growth functions. Reducing CAAL data in these two models also resulted in larger estimation uncertainties in the assessment outputs. Overall, our results suggest that it is important to obtain more age data from long-lived species over as long a time span as possible, and aging samples from intermittent years may be considered if there are constraints in time or effort to age all available samples.},

The same phenomenon is also responsible for excessive investment in R\&D and excessive outlays in rent-seeking contests. We propose a ``Partnership Solution'' to eliminate or at least mitigate these excesses. Each of N players joins a partnership in the first stage and chooses his effort in the second stage. Under the rules of a partnership, each member must pay his own cost of effort but receives an equal share of the partnership's revenue. The incentive to free-ride created by such partnerships turns out to be beneficial since it naturally offsets the excessive effort inherent in such problems. In our two-stage game, this institutional arrangement can, under specified circumstances, induce the social optimum in a subgame-perfect equilibrium: no one has a unilateral incentive (1) to switch to another partnership (or create a new partnership) in the first stage or (2) to deviate from socially optimal actions in the second stage. The game may have other subgame-perfect equilibria, but the one associated with the ``Partnership Solution'' is strictly preferred by every player. We also propose a modification of the first stage which generates a unique subgame-perfect equilibrium. Antitrust authorities should recognize that partnerships can have a less benign use. By organizing as competing partnerships, an industry can reduce the ``excessive'' output of Cournot oligopoly to the monopoly level. Since no partner has any incentive to overproduce in the current period, there is no need to deter cheating with threats of future punishments.},

  abstract = {Hake stocks off the northeast and northwest coasts of the United States and Canada have been commercially exploited since the early 1950s and have been major contributors to the historic world-wide hake catches. During the last two decades annual U.S. hake catches have averaged approximately 300,000 tonnes with the dominant share coming from the coastal Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) stock. Pacific hake occurs over the continental shelf with a number of localized sub populations found in coastal inland waters of Washington State and the Province of British Columbia. In the northwest Atlantic two sympatric species occur, the commercially sought coastal silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) and the offshore hake (Merluccius albidus), which is generally distributed in deeper waters. As with many of the 12 world-wide species of hakes in the genus Merluccius, the U.S. hake species share common attributes in their biology, ecology and population dynamics which may be dictated by the production cycles and circulation patterns characteristic of northerly ecosystems. For instance, both species exhibit a migration pattern centered on spawning in one region followed by feeding in another, both are fast swimming ambush predators that take advantage of high euphausid production as young but transition to a piscivorous diet with age, and both are known to exhibit highly variable, density-dependent related life history characteristics as population regulatory mechanisms. However, these species can be contrasted in many different ways related to specific adaptations within the unique ecosystems in which they live, the diverse and changing fisheries targeting them, and the complexity of stock assessment tools and management structures that have emerged in an attempt to provide a sound scientific basis for setting catch limits. This paper takes a retrospective and contemporary look at these two species, comparing and contrasting our current state of knowledge, highlighting uncertainties and identifying the complex challenges facing assessment and management.},

We have determined that PIPA is a spawning area for skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), bigeye (Thunnus obesus), and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tunas. Our approach included sampling larvae on cruises in 2015\textendash{}2017 and using a biological-physical model to estimate spawning locations for collected larvae. Temperature and chlorophyll conditions varied markedly due to observed ENSO states: El Ni{\~n}o (2015) and neutral (2016\textendash{}2017). However, larval tuna distributions were similar amongst years. Generally, skipjack larvae were patchy and more abundant near PIPA's northeast corner, while Thunnus larvae exhibited lower and more even abundances. Genetic barcoding confirmed the presence of bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) tuna larvae. Model simulations indicated that most of the larvae collected inside PIPA in 2015 were spawned inside, while stronger currents in 2016 moved more larvae across PIPA's boundaries. Larval distributions and relative spawning output simulations indicated that both focal taxa spawned inside PIPA in all 3 study years, demonstrating that PIPA is protecting viable tuna spawning habitat.},

  abstract = {The effective management of marine fisheries is an ongoing challenge at the intersection of biology, economics, and policy. One way in which fish stocks\textemdash{}and their habitats\textemdash{}can be protected is through the establishment of marine reserves, areas that are closed to fishing. Although the potential economic benefits of such reserves have been shown for single-owner fisheries, their implementation quickly becomes complicated when more than one noncooperating harvester is involved in fishery management, which is the case on the high seas. How do multiple self-interested actors distribute their fishing effort to maximize their individual economic gains in the presence of others? Here, we use a game theoretic model to compare the effort distributions of multiple noncooperating harvesters with the effort distributions in the benchmark sole owner and open access cases. In addition to comparing aggregate rent, stock size, and fishing effort, we focus on the occurrence, size, and location of marine reserves. We show that marine reserves are a component of many noncooperative Cournot\textendash{}Nash equilibria. Furthermore, as the number of harvesters increases, (i) both total unfished area and the size of binding reserves (those that actually constrain behavior) may increase, although the latter eventually asymptotically decreases; (ii) total rents and stock size both decline; and (iii) aggregate effort used (i.e., employment) can either increase or decrease, perhaps nonmonotonically.},

This estimator couples the contemporaneous expected utility associated with fishing a specific site with the expected value of future optimal behavior for all future location choices on the cruise. We show that producers attempting to avoid dolphins faced a smaller set of viable sites as compared to producers actively targeting dolphins. Thus, the spatial distribution of effort within the fishery was significantly altered following the implementation of ``dolphin-safe'' tuna labeling in the early 1990s. We also show that vessels attempting to meet the label criteria were willing to pay substantial amounts to increase the spatial distribution of fishing grounds amenable to dolphin avoidance, but a mandatory eco-label would have been quite costly to all fishermen in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) compared to the voluntary label implemented in 1990.},

  abstract = {Effective management is necessary if small-scale fisheries, such as those found in mixed habitats including seagrass and coral reefs, are to continue providing food for many of the poorest communities of the world. Gear-based management, although under represented and under studied, has the potential to be adaptive, address multiple objectives, and be crafted to the socio-economic setting. Management effectiveness in seagrass and coral reef fisheries has generally been evaluated at the scale of the fish community. However, community level indicators can mask species-specific declines that provide significant portions of the fisheries yields and income. Using a unique dataset, containing ten years of species level length frequency catch data from a multi-gear, multi-species seagrass and coral reef fishery in Kenya, we evaluate species specific fishery statuses, compare gear use to gear regulations and estimate the potential needs for further gear restrictions. Despite the high diversity of the fishery, fifteen species represented over 90\% of the catch, and only three species represented 60\% of the catch. The three most abundant species in the catch, Lethrinus lentjan (Lacep{\`e}de), Siganus sutor (Valenciennes) and Leptoscarus vaigiensis (Quoy \& Gaimard) all showed evidence of growth overfishing. Lethrinus lentjan, with an exploitation rate of 0.82, also shows evidence of recruitment overfishing. Current legal but weakly enforced gear restrictions are capable of protecting a significant portion of the catch up to maturity but optimization of yield will require that the current mesh size be increased from 6.3 to 8.8 and 9.2 cm to increase yields of L. lentjan and S. sutor, respectively. Given the difficulties of enforcing mesh size, we recommend that the economic benefits of these larger mesh sizes be communicated and enforced through co-management.

Here, we collate all available data for experimental and comparative studies of trawling impacts on whole communities of seabed macroinvertebrates on sedimentary habitats and develop widely applicable methods to estimate depletion and recovery rates of biota after trawling. Depletion of biota and trawl penetration into the seabed are highly correlated. Otter trawls caused the least depletion, removing 6\% of biota per pass and penetrating the seabed on average down to 2.4 cm, whereas hydraulic dredges caused the most depletion, removing 41\% of biota and penetrating the seabed on average 16.1 cm. Median recovery times posttrawling (from 50 to 95\% of unimpacted biomass) ranged between 1.9 and 6.4 y. By accounting for the effects of penetration depth, environmental variation, and uncertainty, the models explained much of the variability of depletion and recovery estimates from single studies. Coupled with large-scale, high-resolution maps of trawling frequency and habitat, our estimates of depletion and recovery rates enable the assessment of trawling impacts on unprecedented spatial scales.},

We analyzed data from scientific stock assessments, and from a statistical model for other fish stocks, to summarize the past and present status, and the potential catch, abundance and profit for 4713 fish stocks constituting 78\% of global fisheries. Three major scenarios of future trends are considered; business as usual (BAU) in which largely unmanaged fisheries move towards bioeconomic equilibrium but where well-managed fisheries maintain their management, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in which fisheries are managed to maximize yield, and fisheries reform (REF) where the competitive race to fish is eliminated and fisheries are managed to maximize profit. The future prospects differ greatly based on region of the world and product type. This analysis forecasts that yield in major tuna and forage fish species will remain roughly the same as current levels under all three scenarios, while there does appear to be potential for increased yield of whitefish. There is considerable room for increased profit in most of these fisheries from better management. Increased yield will come from rebuilding overexploited stocks, reducing fishing mortality on stocks that are still abundant but fished at high rates, and surprisingly from fishing some stocks harder. Indeed in Europe and North America the primary potential for increased yield comes from fully exploiting stocks that are now lightly exploited. Asia provides the greatest opportunity for increased fish abundance and increased profit by fisheries reform that would lead to reduced fishing pressure.},

I consider the true meaning of the precautionary approach and the trend toward neglect of the purpose of a fishery\textemdash{}to produce social and economic benefits to society; it is those benefits that need protection. Finally, I suggest that the key to successful fisheries management is not better science, better reference points, or more precautionary approaches but rather implementing systems of marine governance that provide incentives for individual fishermen, scientists, and managers to make decisions in their own interest that contribute to societal goals.},

It is shown that the catch is highly concentrated in the recreational fishery with a small proportion of frequent anglers catching a large portion of the fish. Catch is more equitably distributed in the purse seine fishery.

  abstract = {Marine reserves are a promising tool for fisheries management and conservation of biodiversity, but they are not a panacea for fisheries management problems. For fisheries that target highly mobile single species with little or no by-catch or habitat impact, marine reserves provide few benefits compared to conventional fishery management tools. For fisheries that are multi-species or on more sedentary stocks, or for which broader ecological impacts of fishing are an issue, marine reserves have some potential advantages. Their successful use requires a case-by-case understanding of the spatial structure of impacted fisheries, ecosystems and human communities. Marine reserves, together with other fishery management tools, can help achieve broad fishery and biodiversity objectives, but their use will require careful planning and evaluation. Mistakes will be made, and without planning, monitoring and evaluation, we will not learn what worked, what did not, and why. If marine reserves are implemented without case by case evaluation and appropriate monitoring programs, there is a risk of unfulfilled expectations, the creation of disincentives, and a loss of credibility of what potentially is a valuable management tool.},

  abstract = {Increasing attention is being paid to overfishing and the biological, economic, and social implications of persistent mismanagement of aquatic natural resources. In this chorus of concern, little attention is focused on sustainable fisheries, and the lessons to be learned from management systems that produce these successes. Although there is no one prescription for sustainability, a range of quota-based management tools have been used to eliminate the race for fish, increasing the incentives for long-term investment and efficiency. Variously referred to as fishing rights, tenure rights, or dedicated access privileges, quota-based fisheries confer a percentage (or quota) of the total allowable catch to named entities over some predetermined period, from short-term auction systems to intergenerational customary sea tenure. Whether a rights-based system stems from a traditional fishing rights system or has been recently introduced into modern commercial fisheries, achieving sustainability in the fishery is dependent on incentivizing the collective \textendash{} from local communities to national fleets \textendash{} to actively participate in self-regulation of the resource. Thus criticism of the approach often stems from the observation of the potential for cheating at the individual level (e.g., high grading, excessive discards), and the necessary exclusivity that accompanies any transition in management from open access to club membership. It is also worth noting that the resource in question \textendash{} the fish \textendash{} remain a public good, and as such, the public should be compensated \textendash{} or at least not taxed \textendash{} for their use. Thus the cost of fishery management, and the windfall profits of fishery conversion, should be shared. Rights-based management is not a silver bullet, and is probably not appropriate for all fisheries; however, the successes of the longline fisheries for Pacific halibut and sablefish in Alaska, the artisanal fisheries for loco in Chile and for spiny lobster in Mexico, and the Australian fisheries for Northern prawns and rock lobster, all clearly indicate that fishing rights should have a central place in the fisheries management toolbox.},

We explore the impact of implementing an MPA in a spatially structured model of a single-species fish stock that is regulated by total allowable catch (TAC). We find that when a stock is managed at maximum sustainable yield, or is overfished, implementation of an MPA will require a reduction in TAC to avoid increased fishing pressure on the stock outside the MPA. In both cases, catches will be lower as a result of overlaying an MPA on existing fisheries management. Only when the stock is so overfished that it is headed towards extinction does an MPA not lead to lower catches.

Two current trends are the acceptance of objectives that value less disturbed ecosystems and acceptance of fisheries allocation through dedicated access to improve the fisheries' economic efficiency.

A range of policies are explored to find those that produce ``Pretty Good Yield'' defined as sustainable yield at least 80\% of the maximum sustainable yield. Such yields are generally obtained over a broad range of stock sizes (20\textendash{}50\% of unfished stock abundance), and this range is not sensitive to the population's basic life history parameters such as natural mortality rate, somatic growth rate, or age at maturity. The most important biological parameter determining this range is the intensity of recruitment compensation. Meta-analysis shows compensation is usually strong and there is reasonably little yield lost at what are now widely accepted definitions of overfishing or risk for most stocks. Similarly, maintaining stocks at 50\% of unfished stock abundance for ecological or economic reasons results in little expected loss of yield.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a personal perspective on the future of ecosystem based fisheries management (EBFM). I begin with the question, ``if we did single species management well, would EBFM be necessary.'' The answer to this is yes, because pure single-species management does not consider impacts on non-target species, trophic interactions among species, and habitat-destroying fishing practices. Pure single-species management conflicts with a range of legislation designed to protect non-target species and habitats within the U.S. and a number of other countries. The most important elements of EBFM are keeping fishing mortality rates low enough to prevent ecosystem-wide overfishing, reducing or eliminating by-catch and avoiding habitat-destroying fishing methods. There is a second phase of EBFM I call ``extended EBFM'' that consists of considering trophic interactions and area-based management. While there are now models of the trophic interactions for most highly managed ecosystems, and there are area-based management efforts underway in many places, I am not convinced that we are really ready, scientifically and administratively, to apply these forms of EBFM, because they are expensive and require complex trade-offs that are often ill-defined.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Although it is recognized that marine wild-capture fisheries are an important source of food for much of the world, the cost of sustainable capture fisheries to species diversity is uncertain, and it is often questioned whether industrial fisheries can be managed sustainably. We evaluated the trade-off among sustainable food production, profitability, and conservation objectives in the groundfish bottom-trawl fishery off the U.S. West Coast, where depletion (i.e., reduction in abundance) of six rockfish species (Sebastes) is of particular concern. Trade-offs are inherent in this multispecies fishery because there is limited capacity to target species individually. From population models and catch of 34 stocks of bottom fish, we calculated the relation between harvest rate, long-term yield (i.e., total weight of fish caught), profit, and depletion of each species. In our models, annual ecosystem-wide yield from all 34 stocks was maximized with an overall 5.4\% harvest rate, but profit was maximized at a 2.8\% harvest rate. When we reduced harvest rates to the level (2.2\% harvest rate) at which no stocks collapsed ({$<$}10\% of unfished levels), biomass harvested was 76\% of the maximum sustainable yield and profit 89\% of maximum. A harvest rate under which no stocks fell below the biomass that produced maximum sustainable yield (1\% harvest rate), resulted in 45\% of potential yield and 67\% of potential profit. Major reductions in catch in the late 1990s led to increase in the biomass of the most depleted stocks, but this rebuilding resulted in the loss of {$>$}30\% of total sustainable yield, whereas yield lost from stock depletion was 3\% of total sustainable yield. There are clear conservation benefits to lower harvest rates, but avoiding overfishing of all stocks in a multispecies fishery carries a substantial cost in terms of lost yield and profit.},

Using an updated database that has over 100 stocks that were depleted to less than 20\% of their maximum observed stock size, we tested for depensatory behaviour in both total surplus production and recruitment and we also examined the probability of stock increase as a function of stock size and fishing pressure. The number of stocks that showed a significant improvement with depensatory models was less than that expected by chance. Hierarchical meta-analysis showed that the majority of the evidence was for no depensatory behaviour but could not rule out depensation at very low stock sizes. Stocks that are depleted to low abundance are expected to rebuild when fishing pressure is reduced if the environment has not changed but there is considerable evidence that the majority of fish stocks are impacted by changes in productivity regimes. Nevertheless, if stocks are very heavily depleted and fishing pressure is not reduced to quite low levels, the expected recovery time is both uncertain and long. Very low abundance should clearly be avoided for many reasons and the range of abundance where depensation cannot be ruled out is well below commonly adopted limit reference points.},

The result has been that each group (scientists, economists, NGOs etc.) defines ``sustainable seafood'' using whatever criteria it considers most important, and the same fish product may be deemed sustainable by one group and totally unsustainable by another one.

Most existing analyses suggest overfishing is increasing, and there is widespread concern that fish stocks are decreasing throughout most of the world. We assembled trends in abundance and harvest rate of stocks that are scientifically assessed, constituting half of the reported global marine fish catch. For these stocks, on average, abundance is increasing and is at proposed target levels. Compared with regions that are intensively managed, regions with less-developed fisheries management have, on average, 3-fold greater harvest rates and half the abundance as assessed stocks. Available evidence suggests that the regions without assessments of abundance have little fisheries management, and stocks are in poor shape. Increased application of area-appropriate fisheries science recommendations and management tools are still needed for sustaining fisheries in places where they are lacking.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the impact of fishing low trophic level ``forage'' species on higher trophic level marine predators including other fish, birds and marine mammals. We show that existing analyses using trophic models have generally ignored a number of important factors including (1) the high level of natural variability of forage fish, (2) the weak relationship between forage fish spawning stock size and recruitment and the role of environmental productivity regimes, (3) the size distribution of forage fish, their predators and subsequent size selective predation (4) the changes in spatial distribution of the forage fish as it influences the reproductive success of predators. We show that taking account of these factors generally tends to make the impact of fishing forage fish on their predators less than estimated from trophic models. We also explore the empirical relationship between forage fish abundance and predator abundance for a range of U.S. fisheries and show that there is little evidence for a strong connection between forage fish abundance and the rate of change in the abundance of their predators. We suggest that any evaluation of harvest policies for forage fish needs to include these issues, and that models tailored for individual species and ecosystems are needed to guide fisheries management policy.},

In some cases, this concern has extended to predictions of imminent collapse with minimal chances of recovery, even under a commercial catch moratorium. As a viable alternative to a full fishery closure, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) has adopted a scientifically tested, adaptive rebuilding strategy for the depleted southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) stock. The management procedure (MP) adopted involves a harvest control rule that fully specifies the total allowable catch as a function of key indicators of stock status, adjusting future harvest levels every three years so as to meet the rebuilding targets agreed by CCSBT. It was chosen from a subset of candidate MPs selected following extensive simulation testing. This involved first selecting a wide range of plausible scenarios for stock status and input data, ranging from pessimistic to optimistic, against which the alternative candidate MPs were tested to ensure that they were robust to important uncertainties. This is the first time that a comprehensively evaluated MP has been adopted for an internationally managed tuna stock. Both the process and the outcomes have broad applicability to other internationally managed stocks.},

Being able to understand which model(s) best describe this growth trajectory, both empirically and ultimately mechanistically, is an important challenge. A variety of equations have been proposed to describe growth during ontogeny. Recently, the West Brown Enquist (WBE) equation, formulated as part of the metabolic theory of ecology, has been proposed as a universal model of growth. This equation has the advantage of having a biological basis, but its ability to describe invertebrate growth patterns has not been well tested against other, more simple models. In this study, we collected data for 58 species of marine invertebrate from 15 different taxa. The data were fitted to three growth models (power, exponential and WBE), and their abilities were examined using an information theoretic approach. Using Akaike information criteria, we found changes in mass through time to fit an exponential equation form best (in approx. 73\% of cases). The WBE model predominantly overestimates body size in early ontogeny and underestimates it in later ontogeny; it was the best fit in approximately 14\% of cases. The exponential model described growth well in nine taxa, whereas the WBE described growth well in one of the 15 taxa, the Amphipoda. Although the WBE has the advantage of being developed with an underlying proximate mechanism, it provides a poor fit to the majority of marine invertebrates examined here, including species with determinate and indeterminate growth types. In the original formulation of the WBE model, it was tested almost exclusively against vertebrates, to which it fitted well; the model does not however appear to be universal given its poor ability to describe growth in benthic or pelagic marine invertebrates.},

Here, we provide a general scaling model of maximum speed with body mass, which holds across locomotion modes, ecosystem types and taxonomic groups. In contrast to traditional power-law scaling, we predict a hump-shaped relationship resulting from a finite acceleration time for animals, which explains why the largest animals are not the fastest. This model is strongly supported by extensive empirical data (474 species, with body masses ranging from 30\,{$\mu$}g to 100\,tonnes) from terrestrial as well as aquatic ecosystems. Our approach unravels a fundamental constraint on the upper limit of animal movement, thus enabling a better understanding of realized movement patterns in nature and their multifold ecological consequences. Maximum speed could scale with body mass, but the largest animals are not actually the fastest. A general scaling law explains this with a hump-shaped relationship due to a finite limit on acceleration time.},

  abstract = {Summary We explore the potential use of health care as a metaphor for landscape-scale conservation. In human health-care provision, a range of care options is generally available to cover the various levels of treatment required and the degree of urgency of that treatment. The concept of triage is frequently used in emergency situations where many people may be injured and decisions have to be made on the relative urgency of treatment for different individuals versus the relative likelihood of the success of that treatment. Indeed, the need to decide on level and type of care extends throughout health-care provision, and the array of health-care options available can be displayed on a grid that considers relative level of need or threat and the probability of recovery. A similar grid can be constructed for landscape management, which considers level of threat and the probability of system persistence or recovery. The grid differentiates between a variety of scenarios ranging from the need for prompt management action to protect or restore important habitat through to preventative threat minimization. We suggest that the broad concept of triage goes beyond the simple allocation of patients, landscapes or species into urgent, not urgent, and terminal categories and, instead, offers a rational basis for considering allocation of appropriate levels of management to different situations. We also suggest that the practice of restoration has much to learn from health care, where decisions are made daily on the allocation of appropriate levels of care.},

 weight and by number) from 1951, catch rates, and the length-frequency by sex. 
 The uncertainty associated with the estimates of exploitable biomass and egg 
 production was assessed according to Bayesian methods. The output of the 
 assessment formed the basis for projections intended to determine the risk 
 associated with different future levels of effort and catch. Reference points 
 based on estimated biomass and egg production relative to the start of the

These are aimed at safeguarding important marine habitats and species, significant natural features, and areas of cultural heritage and aesthetic value. However, MPAs impact the fishery for southern rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii), as total allowable catches (TACs) were previously set to allow the biomass to recover to pre-specified target levels. The model on which assessments and risk analyses are based is extended to include the impact of MPAs. The MPAs and the area open to fishing are modelled as subpopulations with different levels of mortality and consequently different density and population size-structure. A range for the probability of a lobster moving from a MPA to the fished area from 0 to 15\% is considered, based on the results of tagging studies. The reduction of biomass available to the commercial fishery because of the introduction of MPAs is estimated to be 8\% and 16\% (Western and Eastern Zones) respectively. The results of a risk assessment show that if the current TACs are maintained, the time to increase the biomass available to the commercial fishery by 50\% would be delayed 5\textendash{}9 years in the Western Zone and 1\textendash{}4 years in the Eastern Zone because of the impact of displaced effort. In contrast, spawning biomass in the Eastern Zone is currently below the agreed limit reference point, and the introduction of MPAs would enhance the rate of recovery, although only marginally initially, faster than the absence of the MPAs.},

  abstract = {Management of fisheries around the world is challenged by fishing impacts on habitats, bycatch species, threatened and endangered species, and even associated ecological communities. One response to these other factors has been a call for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), which demands consideration of the above non-target interactions. A challenge with implementation of EBFM is the scale and range of issues to be considered, all of which cannot be addressed at the same level of detail as for target species, due to data or time constraints. We developed an approach to progress the EBFM mandate in Australia, using a new ecological risk assessment framework applied to fisheries, termed Ecological Risk Assessment for the Effects of Fishing (ERAEF). Novel features of this framework include its hierarchical structure and its precautionary approach to uncertainty. The amount of information required increases through the hierarchy, and allows application in data-limited situations. The ERAEF framework has been applied to over 30 fisheries in Australia and elsewhere. The efficiencies in application of the hierarchical approach are illustrated by the south-east otter trawl fishery, where following Level 1 assessment of all components, an initial set of 600 species and 158 habitats was reduced to a group of concern of 159 species and 46 habitats using the Level 2 analysis, with the number of species of concern further reduced to 25 following Level 3 analysis. As a result of the assessments in Australia, management actions have been enacted for a range of the high risk species. Overall, the ERAEF approach offers a realistic method to assess ecological risk in an EBFM context, and has applicability in a wide range of fisheries. The interactive and inclusive nature of the approach also has the advantage of bringing stakeholders, scientists and managers together to develop management solutions.},

However, it can be difficult to attain reasonable precision unless sampling effort is extensive. Indeed, estimates of survival exceeding 100\% are not infrequently obtained. We show that data from several years can be analyzed simultaneously to obtain a single estimate of survival under the assumption that survival is constant over the period analyzed. The method requires that only a single cohort be identified and separated from the other age-groups. Thus there are minimal data requirements. Estimates of the survival of goosefish Lophius americanus obtained by this method compare favorably with estimates obtained by analyzing changes in mean length over time.},

Modelling combined harvest and effort regulations: the case of the Dutch beam trawl fishery for plaice and sole in the North Sea. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 65: 822\textendash{}831.Currently, several European fishing fleets are regulated through a combination of harvest and effort control. The two regulation schemes are interrelated, i.e. a given quota limit will necessarily determine the effort used, and vice versa. It is important to acknowledge this causality when assessing combined effort and harvest regulation systems. A bioeconomic feedback model is presented that takes into account the causality between effort and harvest control by switching back and forth between the two, depending on which is the binding rule. The model consists of a biological and an economic operation module, the former simulating stock assessment and quota establishment, and the latter simulating the economic fleet dynamics. When harvest control is binding, catch is evaluated using the biological projection formula, whereas the economics-based Cobb\textendash{}Douglas production function is used when effort is binding. The method is applied to the Dutch beam trawl fishery for plaice and sole in the North Sea.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size \{\textbackslash{}epsilon\} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter \{\textbackslash{}epsilon\} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

These regulatory practices are neither feasible nor desirable for many fisheries, and have failed to conserve fishery stocks in other fisheries. Marine reserves may be an effective alternative management strategy for some fisheries. Here we develop a dynamic model of marine reserves applicable to inshore fisheries. In contrast to previous models of reserves, the model is fully dynamic and provides information on both equilibrium conditions and the path to equilibrium. A simulation model based on red snapper data from the Gulf of Mexico is presented. The simulation results suggest that marine reserves can sustain or increase yields for moderate to heavily fished fisheries but will probably not improve yields for lightly fished fisheries.},

These programs are generally publicly funded, but in a few cases they have been financed by loans to be paid back by the remaining fleet. In 2003, a buyback permanently removed 91 vessels and 239 fishing permits from the Pacific groundfish trawl fishery and associated corollary fisheries of Dungeness crab and pink shrimp. The buyback was financed with \$10 million in public funding and a \$36 million loan to be repaid over 30 years with fees on landings. In the same year, a control date was set for catch share program in the groundfish trawl fishery. When the catch share program was implemented in 2011, the permit owners that remained in the fishery after the buyback were allocated the quota shares that would otherwise have been issued to the permits bought back in 2003. Estimates of the annual profits generated by this quota are compared to the cost of servicing the buyback loan. The results provide evidence that a buyback program, when implemented in conjunction with catch shares, can enable a sustained increase in profitability for the remaining vessels sufficient to justify its cost. However, using landings taxes as the mechanism to repay the loan may result in a mismatch between those who benefit from and pay for the buyback.},

This paper compares different methods for modeling fish and shellfish responses to climate change on global and regional scales. Several different modeling approaches are considered including: direct applications of ESM's, use of ESM output for estimation of shifts in bioclimatic windows, using ESM outputs to force single- and multi-species stock projection models, and using ESM and physical climate model outputs to force regional bio-physical models of varying complexity and mechanistic resolution. We evaluate the utility of each of these modeling approaches in addressing nine key questions relevant to climate change impacts on living marine resources. No single modeling approach was capable of fully addressing each question. A blend of highly mechanistic and less computationally intensive methods is recommended to gain mechanistic insights and to identify model uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Risk assessments quantify the probability of undesirable events along with their consequences. They are used to prioritize management interventions and assess tradeoffs, serving as an essential component of ecosystem-based management (EBM). A central objective of most risk assessments for conservation and management is to characterize uncertainty and impacts associated with one or more pressures of interest. Risk assessments have been used in marine resource management to help evaluate the risk of environmental, ecological, and anthropogenic pressures on species or habitats including for data-poor fisheries management (e.g., toxicity, probability of extinction, habitat alteration impacts). Traditionally, marine risk assessments focused on singular pressure-response relationships, but recent advancements have included use of risk assessments in an EBM context, providing a method for evaluating the cumulative impacts of multiple pressures on multiple ecosystem components. Here, we describe a conceptual framework for ecosystem risk assessment (ERA), highlighting its role in operationalizing EBM, with specific attention to ocean management considerations. This framework builds on the ecotoxicological and conservation literature on risk assessment and includes recent advances that focus on risks posed by fishing to marine ecosystems. We review how examples of ERAs from the United States fit into this framework, explore the variety of analytical approaches that have been used to conduct ERAs, and assess the challenges and data gaps that remain. This review discusses future prospects for ERAs as EBM decision-support tools, their expanded role in integrated ecosystem assessments, and the development of next-generation risk assessments for coupled natural\textendash{}human systems.},

Our model assumes two product types, one of which is processed and storable. The model describes the equilibrium that results when effort responds to open access incentives and when regulators respond to effort growth by mitigating its potential harmful effects on biomass safety. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate a mechanism by which market growth leads to the diversion of raw inputs into the inherently inferior market. The result is a scenario in which rents are dissipated not only because excessive inputs raise costs, but also because inferior product types reduce revenues. We conclude with an illustrative decomposition of rent gains into revenue and cost savings gains from rationalizing a hypothetical fishery, demonstrating the potential significance of market-side rents.},

However, the spatial nature of the interplay between potential threats and predator life histories requires careful consideration for the establishment of effective reserves. Modeling tools such as demographic sensitivity analysis will aid in establishing protection for different life stages and distributional ranges.

  abstract = {Data on the length structure of exploited stocks are one of the easiest sources of information to obtain for data-poor fisheries, and have the potential to provide cost-effective solutions to the management of data-poor fisheries. However, incorporating the results from stock assessments into a formal harvest strategy, defined here as a harvest management system that incorporates monitoring, assessment, and decisions rules for a specific fishery, usually requires information on the total catch or catch-per-unit effort, data that are not available for many data-poor fisheries. This paper describes and tests a harvest strategy where only length composition data of the catch and knowledge of basic biological parameters are available. The harvest strategy uses a recently developed methodology for stock assessment that estimates the spawning potential ratio (SPR) for an exploited stock from the length structure of the catch (the length-based SPR model; LB-SPR), and uses an effort-based harvest control rule to iteratively drive fishing pressure towards a target level of SPR (40\%). A management strategy evaluation framework was used to explore the behaviour of various parameterizations of the harvest control rule for three species with a diverse range of life-histories and M/k ratios ranging from 0.36 (unfished population dominated by large fish) to the Beverton\textendash{}Holt invariant M/k of 1.5 (unfished population dominated by smaller fish). For all three species the harvest strategy was able to guide the fisheries towards the target SPR, although the time taken for the SPR to stabilise at the target SPR was greatest for the species with the greatest longevity and the lowest M/k. The results of this proof-of-concept study demonstrate that the combination of the LB-SPR assessment model with an iterative, effort-based harvest control rule can successfully rebuild an overfished stock back to sustainable levels or fish down a stock to the target SPR without significantly overshooting the target.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the status of data-poor fish stocks is often limited by incomplete knowledge of the basic life history parameters: the natural mortality rate (M), the von Bertalanffy growth parameters (L{$\infty$} and k), and the length at maturity (Lm). A common approach to estimate these individual parameters has been to use the Beverton\textendash{}Holt life history invariants, the ratios M/k and Lm/L{$\infty$}, especially for estimating M. In this study, we assumed no knowledge of the individual parameters, and explored how the information on life history strategy contained in these ratios can be applied to assessing data-poor stocks. We developed analytical models to develop a relationship between M/k and the von Bertalanffy growth curve, and demonstrate the link between the life history ratios and yield- and spawning-per-recruit. We further developed the previously recognized relationship between M/k and yield- and spawning-per-recruit by using information on Lm/L{$\infty$}, knife-edge selectivity (Lc/L{$\infty$}), and the ratio of fishing to natural mortality (F/M), to demonstrate the link between an exploited stock's expected length composition, and its spawning potential ratio (SPR), an internationally recognized measurement of stock status. Variation in length-at-age and logistic selectivity patterns were incorporated in the model to demonstrate how SPR can be calculated from the observed size composition of the catch; an advance which has potential as a cost-effective method for assessing data-poor stocks. A companion paper investigates the effects of deviations in the main assumptions of the model on the application of the analytical models developed in this study as a cost-effective method for stock assessment [Hordyk, A.

Two simple recursive equations, using the life-history ratio of the natural mortality rate to the von Bertalanffy growth parameter (M/K), were developed to generate length composition data, reducing the complexity of the previous approach. Using simulated and empirical data we demonstrate that ignoring Lee's Phenomenon results in over-estimates of fishing mortality and negatively biased estimates of SPR.

Despite being applied to over 1,000 fish populations, and an ongoing debate about the most appropriate method to convert biological and fishery characteristics into an overall measure of risk, the assumptions and predictive capacity of these approaches have not been evaluated. Several interpretations of the PSA were mapped to a conventional age-structured fisheries dynamics model to evaluate the performance of the approach under a range of assumptions regarding exploitation rates and measures of biological risk. The results demonstrate that the underlying assumptions of these qualitative risk-based approaches are inappropriate, and the expected performance is poor for a wide range of conditions. The information required to score a fishery using a PSA-type approach is comparable to that required to populate an operating model and evaluating the population dynamics within a simulation framework. In addition to providing a more credible characterization of complex system dynamics, the operating model approach is transparent, reproducible and can evaluate alternative management strategies over a range of plausible hypotheses for the system.},

Results demonstrated that the current Welsh MPA network, even at the lowest conservation targets ({$\leq$}10\%), fails to suitably represent more than two-thirds of the broad-scale habitats found in its coastal waters. Subsequently, a range of alternative reserve design scenarios was developed to reduce inefficiency opportunity costs. Analysis indicated that an increase of less than 5\% in total reserve area, plus a retention of 75\% of the current network area, would create a new network to meet or exceed all stated conservation goals. Therefore, existing reserves can be incorporated into an efficient, ecologically representative network that reduces international conservation opportunity costs.},

  abstract = {A rapidly growing body of research examines whether human conflict can be affected by climatic changes. Drawing from archaeology, criminology, economics, geography, history, political science, and psychology, we assemble and analyze the 60 most rigorous quantitative studies and document, for the first time, a striking convergence of results. We find strong causal evidence linking climatic events to human conflict across a range of spatial and temporal scales and across all major regions of the world. The magnitude of climate's influence is substantial: for each one standard deviation (1{$\sigma$}) change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall, median estimates indicate that the frequency of interpersonal violence rises 4\% and the frequency of intergroup conflict rises 14\%. Because locations throughout the inhabited world are expected to warm 2{$\sigma$} to 4{$\sigma$} by 2050, amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical impact of anthropogenic climate change.
Introduction Despite the existence of institutions designed to promote peace, interactions between individuals and groups sometimes lead to conflict. Understanding the causes of such conflict is a major project in the social sciences, and researchers in anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, psychology, and sociology have long debated the extent to which climatic changes are responsible. Recent advances and interest have prompted an explosion of quantitative studies on this question.
Climate and conflict across spatial scales. Evidence that temperature influences the risk of modern human conflict: (A) local violence in 1\textdegree{} grid cells, (B) civil war in countries, and (C) civil conflict risk in the tropics. The map depicts regions of analysis corresponding to nonparametric watercolor regressions in (A) to (C). The color intensity in (A) to (C) indicates the level of certainty in the regression line.
Methods We carried out a comprehensive synthesis of the rapidly growing literature on climate and human conflict. We examined many types of human conflict, ranging from interpersonal violence and crime to intergroup violence and political instability and further to institutional breakdown and the collapse of civilizations. We focused on quantitative studies that can reliably infer causal associations between climate variables and conflict outcomes. The studies we examined are experiments or ``natural experiments''; the latter exploit variations in climate over time that are plausibly independent of other variables that also affect conflict. In many cases, we obtained original data from studies that did not meet this criterion and used a common statistical method to reanalyze these data. In total, we evaluated 60 primary studies that have examined 45 different conflict data sets. We collected findings across time periods spanning 10,000 BCE to the present and across all major world regions.
Results Deviations from normal precipitation and mild temperatures systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially. This relationship is apparent across spatial scales ranging from a single building to the globe and at temporal scales ranging from an anomalous hour to an anomalous millennium. Our meta-analysis of studies that examine populations in the post-1950 era suggests that the magnitude of climate's influence on modern conflict is both substantial and highly statistically significant (P {$<$} 0.001). Each 1-SD change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall increases the frequency of interpersonal violence by 4\% and intergroup conflict by 14\% (median estimates).
Discussion We conclude that there is more agreement across studies regarding the influence of climate on human conflict than has been recognized previously. Given the large potential changes in precipitation and temperature regimes projected for the coming decades\textemdash{}with locations throughout the inhabited world expected to warm by 2 to 4 SDs by 2050\textemdash{}amplified rates of human conflict could represent a large and critical social impact of anthropogenic climate change in both low- and high-income countries.
Climate and Conflict
Knowledge silos can hinder attempts to explore questions of interest across many disciplines. Hsiang et al. (p. 1235367, published online 1 August) provide a meta-analysis of data from disciplines as disparate as archaeology and psychology to examine the relation between climate and conflict. Overall, warmer temperatures or extremes of rainfall can be causally associated with changes in interpersonal violence and in civil war.},

Fishermen's strategies in a fully dynamic game account for latent resource dynamics and other players' actions , revealing the profit structure of the fishery. We compare the fishermen's actual and socially optimal exploitation paths under a time-specific vessel allocation policy and find a sizable dynamic externality. Individual fishermen respond to other users by exerting effort above the optimal level early in the season. Congestion is costly instantaneously but is beneficial in the long run because it partially offsets dynamic inefficiencies. (JEL D24, Q21, Q22)},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamic Ocean Circulation Models and Lagrangian particle tracking models are valuable tools e.g. in coastal ecology to identify the connectivity between offshore spawning and coastal nursery areas of commercially important fish, for risk assessment and more for defining or evaluating marine protected areas. Most studies are based on only one model and do not provide levels of uncertainty. Here this uncertainty was addressed by applying a suite of 11 North Sea models to test what variability can be expected concerning connectivity. Different notional test cases were calculated related to three important and well-studied North Sea fish species: herring (Clupea harengus), and the flatfishes sole (Solea solea) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). For sole and plaice we determined which fraction of particles released in the respective spawning areas would reach a coastal marine protected area. For herring we determined the fraction located in a wind park after a predefined time span. As temperature is more and more a focus especially in biological and global change studies, furthermore inter-model variability in temperatures experienced by the virtual particles was determined. The main focus was on the transport variability originating from the physical models and thus biological behavior was not included. Depending on the scenario, median experienced temperatures differed by 3\textdegree{}C between years. The range between the different models in one year was comparable to this temperature range observed between modelled years. Connectivity between flatfish spawning areas and the coastal protected area was highly dependent on the release location and spawning time. No particles released in the English Channel in the sole scenario reached the protected area while up to 20\% of the particles released in the plaice scenario did. Interannual trends in transport directions and connectivity rates were comparable between models but absolute values displayed high variations. Most models showed systematic biases during all years in comparison to the ensemble median, indicating that in general interannual variation was represented but absolute values varied. In conclusion: variability between models is generally high and management decisions or scientific analysis using absolute values from only one single model might be biased and results or conclusions drawn from such studies need to be treated with caution. We further concluded that more true validation data for particle modelling are required.},

  abstract = {Not enough time for recovery
Coral bleaching occurs when stressful conditions result in the expulsion of the algal partner from the coral. Before anthropogenic climate warming, such events were relatively rare, allowing for recovery of the reef between events. Hughes et al. looked at 100 reefs globally and found that the average interval between bleaching events is now less than half what it was before. Such narrow recovery windows do not allow for full recovery. Furthermore, warming events such as El Ni{\~n}o are warmer than previously, as are general ocean conditions. Such changes are likely to make it more and more difficult for reefs to recover between stressful events.
Science, this issue p. 80
Tropical reef systems are transitioning to a new era in which the interval between recurrent bouts of coral bleaching is too short for a full recovery of mature assemblages. We analyzed bleaching records at 100 globally distributed reef locations from 1980 to 2016. The median return time between pairs of severe bleaching events has diminished steadily since 1980 and is now only 6 years. As global warming has progressed, tropical sea surface temperatures are warmer now during current La Ni{\~n}a conditions than they were during El Ni{\~n}o events three decades ago. Consequently, as we transition to the Anthropocene, coral bleaching is occurring more frequently in all El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}Southern Oscillation phases, increasing the likelihood of annual bleaching in the coming decades.
Coral reefs in the present day have less time than in earlier periods to recover from bleaching events.

  abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre?layout (or conventional) and layout?specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

  abstract = {Studies on small and declining populations dominate research in conservation biology. This emphasis reflects two overarching frameworks: the small-population paradigm focuses on correlates of increased extinction probability; the declining-population paradigm directs attention to the causes and consequences of depletion. Neither, however, particularly informs research on the determinants, rate or uncertainty of population increase. By contrast, Allee effects (positive associations between population size and realized per capita population growth rate, rrealized, a metric of average individual fitness) offer a theoretical and empirical basis for identifying numerical and temporal thresholds at which recovery is unlikely or uncertain. Following a critique of studies on Allee effects, I quantify population-size minima and subsequent trajectories of marine fishes that have and have not recovered following threat mitigation. The data suggest that threat amelioration, albeit necessary, can be insufficient to effect recovery for populations depleted to less than 10\% of maximum abundance (Nmax), especially when they remain depleted for lengthy periods of time. Comparing terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, life-history analyses suggest that population-size thresholds for impaired recovery are likely to be comparatively low for marine fishes but high for marine mammals. Articulation of a `recovering population paradigm' would seem warranted. It might stimulate concerted efforts to identify generic impaired recovery thresholds across species. It might also serve to reduce the confusion of terminology, and the conflation of causes and consequences with patterns currently evident in the literature on Allee effects, thus strengthening communication among researchers and enhancing the practical utility of recovery-oriented research to conservation practitioners and resource managers.},

In this paper, the results of the rain forest growth model FORMIND were assessed by a multicriteria decision analysis. The main processes covered by FORMIND include tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. Tree growth is calculated based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest.

Sixty-four different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. The scenarios differ regarding the logging cycle, logging method, cutting limit and logging intensity. We characterise the impacts with four criteria describing the yield, canopy opening and changes in species composition. Multicriteria decision analysis was used for the first time to evaluate the scenarios and identify the efficient ones.

Our results plainly show that reduced-impact logging scenarios are more `efficient' than the others, since in these scenarios forest damage is minimised without significantly reducing yield. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between yield and achieving a desired ecological state of logged forest; the ecological state of the logged forests can only be improved by reducing yields and enlarging the logging cycles. Our study also demonstrates that high cutting limits or low logging intensities cannot compensate for the high level of damage caused by conventional logging techniques.},

Considerable effort has focused on measuring the potential benefits of conservation interventions, but explicit quantification of the financial costs of implementation is rare. Even when costs have been quantified, haphazard and inconsistent reporting means published values are difficult to interpret. This reporting deficiency hinders progress toward a collective understanding of the financial costs of management interventions across projects and thus limits the ability to identify efficient solutions to conservation problems or attract adequate funding. We devised a standardized approach to describing financial costs reported for conservation interventions. The standards call for researchers and practitioners to describe the objective and outcome, context and methods, and scale of costed interventions and to state which categories of costs are included and the currency and date for reported costs. These standards aim to provide enough contextual information that readers and future users can interpret the cost data appropriately. We suggest these standards be adopted by major conservation organizations, conservation science institutions, and journals so that cost reporting is comparable among studies. This would support shared learning and enhance the ability to identify and perform cost-effective conservation.

Based on these experiences and the current legislation, management, technology and methods for evaluating risk, the Guidelines synthesise drought management operational actions that link science and policy and that can be applied to other regions. The Guidelines respond to the growing issue of drought preparedness planning, monitoring, and mitigation which has worldwide application. The methodologies and lessons learned are focused on a specific, drought-prone region so the applications have more significance. The Mediterranean region exemplifies many other drought-prone regions with rapidly expanding populations that are placing increased pressure on already limited water supplies. The Mediterranean region is one that has been identified as experiences significant changes in climate as a result of climate change. Preparing for climatic extremes (i.e., managing climate variability) is an important first step in preparing for climate change. The Guidelines are the result of the research carried out within the framework of the MEDA-Water project MEDROPLAN that analyses drought and water scarcity management in Mediterranean countries promoting a risk based preparedness and mitigation approach. The purpose of the Guidelines is to provide countries with a framework for effective and systematic approach to prevent and/or minimize the impacts of drought on people.},

The program's approach to age assignment differs from previous approaches in that ages are explicitly assigned to individual unaged fish. Because individual age assignment is necessary to describe the variation around estimates of mean catch per effort (CPE) at age and to compare these estimates through standard statistical procedures, the number of fish of a specified age captured in each unit of effort must be known or estimated. Individual age assignment can be confounded by instances of fractionality, where ages cannot be evenly assigned to fish within individual length intervals. Program AGEKEY resolves the problem of fractionality by applying an integer-based approach to age assignment. When we tested the validity of the program with two sample data sets, AGEKEY yielded estimates of age frequency and mean lengths at age that were very similar to estimates calculated through spreadsheet approaches. Program AGEKEY can quickly derive estimates of age frequency and mean lengths at age using an age\textendash{}length key approach that will provide users with the data necessary to describe the precision associated with estimates of CPE at age and allow for statistical comparisons of CPE at age across surveys.},

  abstract = {In Hawaii, a variety of small- and medium-scale pelagic fisheries target fishing effort on a network of coastal moored FADs, natural inshore tuna aggregation points, offshore seamounts and offshore weather monitoring buoys. Large-scale longline vessels also operate in the Hawaii exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and beyond. These circumstances provide an ideal setting for tag-and-release experiments designed to elucidate the movement patterns, residence times, exchange rates and vulnerability of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) within the Hawaiian EEZ. Preliminary recapture data indicate that FADs, island reef ledges and seamounts exert an overwhelming influence on the catchability of tuna. Recapture rates from these locations vastly outweigh tag returns from open water areas. As of August 31, 1999, a total of l5387 bigeye and, yellowfin tuna ranging in size from 29 to 133 cm fork length (FL) and from 26 to143 cm FL respectively (mean 59.8 {$\pm$} 14.1 cm; 58.4 {$\pm$} 17.3 cm) have been tagged and released throughout the Hawaii EEZ. Recapture rates for both species have been similar with an overall recapture rate of l0.3 \%. The location of tag releases reflects the importance of associative behavior and schooling to the vulnerability of tuna; seamounts and FADs accounted for 72.4 \% and 23.5 \% of all tag releases. Within the main Hawaiian Island group (excluding the offshore seamounts and buoys), 83.1 \% of all recaptures have been made on anchored FADs and 11.9 \% of recaptures have come from ledges or tuna aggregation areas close to the islands where bigeye and yellowfin tuna become vulnerable to hook and line gear. As these studies continue, additional and longer-term recaptures will provide increasingly detailed information on the movement patterns and vulnerability of bigeye and yellowfin tuna as they grow, move and recruit to different fisheries.},

In addition to intended changes in the network there is a small probability of unintended changes or errors.

In Social and Economic Networks, Matthew Jackson offers a comprehensive introduction to social and economic networks, drawing on the latest findings in economics, sociology, computer science, physics, and mathematics. He provides empirical background on networks and the regularities that they exhibit, and discusses random graph-based models and strategic models of network formation.

  abstract = {Forage fish are a vital part of marine ecosystems, partly by supporting some of the largest fisheries worldwide, but also due to their role in food webs as prey for larger fish and other predators. One of the unresolved questions about forage fish dynamics is the causes of their significant temporal fluctuations. These fluctuations are often attributed to changes in environmental conditions, but direct correlations have proven hard to find. Here, we show how time-varying predation mortality additionally plays a substantial role in forage fish population fluctuations. By analysing 10 stocks that have estimates of natural mortality changes through time, we find that natural mortality on average increases as population biomass declines towards a trough, and to a lesser degree decreases, when their biomass is growing towards a peak. While depensatory mortality was dominant on average in biomass dynamics leading up to peaks or troughs, some of the stocks exhibited compensatory mortality emphasizing variation between stocks. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of natural mortality and productivity is generally higher than fishing mortality. The results underscore the importance of top-down control on the dynamics of forage fish. We conclude that a holistic ecosystem analysis is required for a better ecological understanding of forage fish dynamics.},

As competition for use of the ocean increases, coastal managers must consider the economic impacts of competing marine sectors in decision-making processes. To capture the full extent of the economic impacts of marine industries, multiplier values can be used to estimate the sum of direct, indirect, and induced effects on associated industries. This study provides a global synthesis of multiplier effects on four economic indicators of eight marine sectors in regions of varying size and development status. The average multiplier was 1.82, indicating that every dollar generated by a direct marine industry leads to an additional 82 cents generated by associated industries. The industry of offshore energy and the economic indicator of revenue had the largest multiplier effects. No significant difference was found between multiplier values in developed and developing regions, and weak correlations were found between multiplier value and region size. This synthesis offers the first global view of the economic multiplier effects of marine industries and can serve as a tool to support city- to country-level marine industry development decisions throughout the world, especially where similar data are not available.},

That is while many problems in computer vision inherently have an underlying high-level structure and can benefit from it. Spatiotemporal graphs are a popular tool for imposing such highlevel intuitions in the formulation of real world problems. In this paper, we propose an approach for combining the power of high-level spatio-temporal graphs and sequence learning success of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We develop a scalable method for casting an arbitrary spatiotemporal graph as a rich RNN mixture that is feedforward, fully differentiable, and jointly trainable. The proposed method is generic and principled as it can be used for transforming any spatio-temporal graph through employing a certain set of well defined steps. The evaluations of the proposed approach on a diverse set of problems, ranging from modeling human motion to object interactions, shows improvement over the state-of-the-art with a large margin. We expect this method to empower new approaches to problem formulation through high-level spatio-temporal graphs and Recurrent Neural Networks.},

This species of porpoise is endemic to the northern Gulf of California, Mexico, and historically the population has declined because of unsustainable bycatch in gillnets. An illegal gillnet fishery for an endangered fish, the totoaba (Totoaba macdonaldi), has recently resurged throughout the vaquita's range. The secretive but lucrative wildlife trade with China for totoaba swim bladders has probably increased vaquita bycatch mortality by an unknown amount. Precise population monitoring by visual surveys is difficult because vaquitas are inherently hard to see and have now become so rare that sighting rates are very low. However, their echolocation clicks can be identified readily on specialized acoustic detectors. Acoustic detections on an array of 46 moored detectors indicated vaquita acoustic activity declined by 80\% between 2011 and 2015 in the central part of the species' range. Statistical models estimated an annual rate of decline of 34\% (95\% Bayesian credible interval \textendash{}48\% to \textendash{}21\%). Based on results from 2011 to 2014, the government of Mexico enacted and is enforcing an emergency 2-year ban on gillnets throughout the species' range to prevent extinction, at a cost of US\$74 million to compensate fishers. Developing precise acoustic monitoring methods proved critical to exposing the severity of vaquitas' decline and emphasizes the need for continual monitoring to effectively manage critically endangered species.},

Providing MSY-based advice for these data-limited stocks remains a challenge for fisheries science. For many data-limited stocks, catch length composition and/or survey biomass indices or catch-per-unit effort (cpue) are available. Information on life history traits may also be available or borrowed from similar species/stocks. In this work we present three harvest control rules (HCRs), driven by indicators derived from key monitoring data. These were tested through simulation using two exploitation scenarios (development and over-exploitation) applied to 50 stocks (pelagic, demersal, deep sea species and Nephrops). We examine the performance of the HCRs to deliver catch-based advice that is risk adverse and drives stocks to MSY. The HCR with a biomass index-adjusted status quo catch, used to provide catch-based advice for several European data-limited stocks, showed the poorest performance, keeping the biomass at low or very low levels. The HCRs that adjust the status quo catch based on the variability of the biomass index time series was able to drive most of the stocks to MSY, showing low to moderate biological risk. The recovery of biomass required asymmetric confidence intervals for the biomass index and larger decreases in status quo catch than increases. The HCR based on length reference points as proxies for the FSQ/FMSY ratio was able to reverse the decreasing trend in biomass but with levels of catch below MSY. This HCR did not prevent some of the stocks declining when subject to over-exploitation. For data-limited stocks, the empirical HCRs tested in this work can provide the basis for catch advice. Nevertheless, applications to real life cases require simulation testing to be carried out to tune the HCRs. Our approach to simulation testing can be used for such analysis.},

The paper identifies programs in about 20 percent of coastal and developing countries and finds that countries with catch shares have higher governance rankings, stronger economies, more valuable fishery export industries, and fewer people employed in fisheries. For example, the average governance effectiveness rank is 38.7 for all coastal and developing countries and 60.8 for countries with quota-based fishing rights. Species managed under quota-based systems are also found to have the potential for strong recruitment externalities. The results support ideas from the fisheries economics literature on the pre-conditions that are more likely to lead to the adoption of a catch share program.},

  abstract = {Natural resource users face a trade-off between present and future consumption. Using harmful methods or extracting unsustainably, lowers future consumption. Therefore, it is reasonable to posit that people with higher time preferences extract more as compared to people with lower time preferences. The present study combines experimental methods and questionnaire data in order to understand the relationship between individual time preferences and fishers' extraction behavior. We elicit individual time preferences using an incentivized experiment, linking the resulting time preference measures to extraction data from a questionnaire, as well as data collected from a framed Common Pool Resource (CPR) experiment. Both the experiments and questionnaire were conducted with artisanal fishers in Zanzibar. Our findings suggest that the relationship between time preferences and CPR extraction is not as straightforward as predicted by classical economic theory. In contrast to earlier studies, we find that fishers' time preferences are negatively correlated to their extraction rates. Our surprising findings can partly be explained by the fact that higher time preferences are associated with lower investment in extraction capability (the disinvestment effect of time preferences), and by fishers\textasciiacute{} cognitive abilities.},

  abstract = {The use of destructive fishing methods is a serious problem, especially for tropical and developing countries. Due to inter temporal nature of fisheries extraction activities, standard economic theory suggests that an individual's time preference can play a major role in determining the gear choice decision. Based on earlier theoretical work we identify two ways in which individual time preferences can impact the adoption of destructive extraction methods; (i) the conservation effect which posits that patient individuals (as indicated by relatively high discount factor) are less likely to use destructive extraction methods since they are more likely to account for the loss of future income that is accompanied by using these methods, (ii) the disinvestment effect which argues that patient individuals are more likely to use destructive extraction methods since they have greater investment capability.
Using an agent-based model we clarify the conditions under which one of these effects is more dominant than the other one. Our model suggests that the nature of destructive gear along with the level of social dilemma determines whether patient or impatient individuals (relatively lower discount factor) are more likely to adopt such a gear. Additionally agent's beliefs regarding future resource condition and other agent's extraction level can have a major influence in some cases.},

Trees take up a lot of CO2, so one approach to reducing the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2 levels is to reduce the cutting down of trees. Jayachandran et al. evaluated a program in which forest owners in Uganda were paid to not cut down their trees. Encouragingly, payments did reduce deforestation, and owners did not compensate by cutting down trees in neighboring forests. Furthermore, even in a scenario where cutting resumed after payments ceased, the beneficial delay in CO2 release from cut trees, as quantified by the social cost of carbon, outweighed the monetary cost.
Science, this issue p. 267
We evaluated a program of payments for ecosystem services in Uganda that offered forest-owning households annual payments of 70,000 Ugandan shillings per hectare if they conserved their forest. The program was implemented as a randomized controlled trial in 121 villages, 60 of which received the program for 2 years. The primary outcome was the change in land area covered by trees, measured by classifying high-resolution satellite imagery. We found that tree cover declined by 4.2\% during the study period in treatment villages, compared to 9.1\% in control villages. We found no evidence that enrollees shifted their deforestation to nearby land. We valued the delayed carbon dioxide emissions and found that this program benefit is 2.4 times as large as the program costs.
Satellite-based observation of Ugandan forests documents the effectiveness of paying owners to not cut down their trees.

  abstract = {Understanding how consumers engage with and view their water usage is crucial to the design of more effective water demand management policies and programmes. This chapter argues that while consumers of water may be aware of the need for water conservation, with many expressing good intentions, consumers can often appear to be disengaged or discouraged from positively responding to measures designed to prompt the adoption of water-efficient strategies and behaviours. This disengagement, or inability of the consumer to engage with water-efficient strategies, is highlighted as being due to a range of socio-economic variables, such as age, gender, income, education as well as wider issues of emotional involvement, personal responsibility and institutional trust, and the existence of a gap in expressed attitude and actual behaviour. As a consequence, it is argued that the adoption of single-track water efficiency strategies, such as water metering or education campaigns, is unlikely to be sufficient in its own right, particularly in the medium to long term. Instead, it is suggested that the complexity of human behaviour is more openly recognised and that more diverse and innovative approaches to water efficiency are developed.},

These metrics show relatively consistent responses to size-selective exploitation, and ``unexploited'' indicator reference points may be predicted with models of size-structured foodwebs. Whereas unexploited reference points provide a baseline for assessing the relative magnitude of fishing impacts, target or limit reference points are needed to guide management. Values for target or limit reference points are difficult to justify on scientific grounds. However, given that fishing impacts in most ecosystems need to be reduced to meet the objectives of the EAFM, we argue that reference directions provide alternative medium-term management targets. We show that the power of surveys to detect trends consistent with reference directions depends on the range of body size classes included in the analysis. Selection of different size ranges will weight metrics to respond to the release of small fish from predation, the depletion of larger individuals as a consequence of exploitation, or both. Such weightings may not be consistent over time, because the differential vulnerability of larger species, within-population changes, predator\textendash{}prey relationships, and the effects of competition depend on contemporary rates of fishing mortality and the history of exploitation. The power of the surveys investigated is poor on time scales of less than 5\textendash{}10 years. Therefore, size-based indicators provide better support for medium-term, rather than year-on-year, management decision making.},

  abstract = {Indicators are needed to support the implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), by providing information on the state of the ecosystem, the extent and intensity of effort or mortality and the progress of management in relation to objectives. Here, I review recent work on the development, selection and application of indicators and consider how indicators might support an EAF. Indicators should guide the management of fishing activities that have led to, or are most likely to lead to, unsustainable impacts on ecosystem components or attributes. The numbers and types of indicators used to support an EAF will vary among management regions, depending on resources available for monitoring and enforcement, and actual and potential fishing impacts. State indicators provide feedback on the state of ecosystem components or attributes and the extent to which management objectives, which usually relate to state, are met. State can only be managed if the relationships with fishing (pressure) and management (response) are known. Predicting such relationships is fundamental to developing a management system that supports the achievement of objectives. In a management framework supported by pressure, state and response indicators, the relationship between the value of an indicator and a target or limit reference point, reference trajectory or direction provides guidance on the management action to take. Values of pressure, state and response indicators may be affected by measurement, process, model and estimation error and thus different indicators, and the same indicators measured at different scales and in different ways, will detect true trends on different timescales. Managers can use several methods to estimate the effects of error on the probability of detecting true trends and/or to account for error when setting reference points, trajectories and directions. Given the high noise to signal ratio in many state indicators, pressure and response indicators would often guide short-term management decision making more effectively, with state indicators providing longer-term policy-focused feedback on the effects of management action.},

A total of 460 ``lobster nights'' (data on one lobster for 1 night) was recorded during the study. On 48 of these ``lobster nights'', the lobsters did not forage. Approximately half of the remaining data were incomplete or ``censored'' due to lobsters moving outside the tracking area for part of the night. A Weibull distribution showed an extremely close fit to the data after adjustment for the bias of censoring. Through analyses of deviance, comparisons were made of the effect on distance travelled of sampling time, sex, and time since tagging in a way that was analogous to an analysis of variance. The results of the study indicate that nocturnal foraging distances were variable: 95\% of the population covered between 72.5 and 585 m {$\cdot$} night-1. These distances, which are much greater than previously reported, show that the animals have an unexpectedly large foraging area. The effect on survival of P. cygnus of limited food supply due to small foraging distances may not be as important as previously believed.},

  abstract = {Learning where and when
Large ungulate migrations occur across continents and inspire curiosity about how these animals know when to leave and where to go. Jesmer et al. took advantage of regional extinctions and reintroductions of several North American ungulate species to determine the role of learning in migrations (see the Perspective by Festa-Bianchet). Reintroduced populations of bighorn sheep and moose did not migrate as historical herds had. However, after several decades, newly established herds were better able to track the emergence of vegetation in the environment and were increasingly migratory. Thus, newly introduced animals learned about their environment and shared the information through social exchange.
Science, this issue p. 1023; see also p. 972
Ungulate migrations are assumed to stem from learning and cultural transmission of information regarding seasonal distribution of forage, but this hypothesis has not been tested empirically. We compared the migratory propensities of bighorn sheep and moose translocated into novel habitats with those of historical populations that had persisted for hundreds of years. Whereas individuals from historical populations were largely migratory, translocated individuals initially were not. After multiple decades, however, translocated populations gained knowledge about surfing green waves of forage (tracking plant phenology) and increased their propensity to migrate. Our findings indicate that learning and cultural transmission are the primary mechanisms by which ungulate migrations evolve. Loss of migration will therefore expunge generations of knowledge about the locations of high-quality forage and likely suppress population abundance.
Bighorn sheep and moose learn their migration routes through culture and experience.

Hierarchical Bayesian methods are especially applicable to small-area, small-sample-size estimation problems because they allow poor-data species to borrow strength from species with good-quality data. We used a hammerhead shark complex as an example to investigate the advantages of using hierarchical Bayesian models in assessing the status of poor-data and data-poor exploited species. The hammerhead shark complex (Sphyrna spp.) along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States is composed of three species: the scalloped hammerhead (S. lewini), the great hammerhead (S. mokarran), and the smooth hammerhead (S. zygaena) sharks. The scalloped hammerhead comprises 70\textendash{}80\% of the catch and has catch and relative abundance data of good quality, whereas great and smooth hammerheads have relative abundance indices that are both limited and of low quality presumably because of low stock density and limited sampling. Four hierarchical Bayesian state-space surplus production models were developed to simulate variability in population growth rates, carrying capacity, and catchability of the species. The results from the hierarchical Bayesian models were considerably more robust than those of the nonhierarchical models. The hierarchical Bayesian approach represents an intermediate strategy between traditional models that assume different population parameters for each species and those that assume all species share identical parameters. Use of the hierarchical Bayesian approach is suggested for future hammerhead shark stock assessments and for modeling fish complexes with species-specific data, because the poor-data species can borrow strength from the species with good data, making the estimation more stable and robust.},

  abstract = {In many marine fisheries assessments, population abundance indices from surveys collected by different states and agencies do not always agree with each other. This phenomenon is often due to the spatial synchrony/asynchrony. Those indices that are asynchronous may result in discrepancies in the assessment of temporal trends. In addition, commonly employed stock assessment models, such as the statistical catch-at-age (SCA) models, do not account for spatial synchrony/asynchrony associated with spatial autocorrelation, dispersal, and environmental noise. This limits the value of statistical inference on key parameters associated with population dynamics and management reference points. To address this problem, a set of geospatial analyses of relative abundance indices is proposed to model the indices from different surveys using spatial hierarchical Bayesian models. This approach allows better integration of different surveys with spatial synchrony and asynchrony. We used Atlantic weakfish (Cynoscion regalis) as an example for which there are state-wide surveys and expansive coastal surveys. We further compared the performance of the proposed spatially structured hierarchical Bayesian SCA models with a commonly used Bayesian SCA model that assumes relative abundance indices are spatially independent. Three spatial models developed to mimic different potential spatial patterns were compared. The random effect spatially structured hierarchical Bayesian model was found to be better than the commonly used SCA model and the other two spatial models. A simulation study was conducted to evaluate the uncertainty resulting from model selection and the robustness of the recommended model. The spatially structured hierarchical Bayesian model was shown to be able to integrate different survey indices with/without spatial synchrony. It is suggested as a useful tool when there are surveys with different spatial characteristics that need to be combined in a fisheries stock assessment.},

Empirical data from 1999 to 2008 are compiled on the economic values arising from commercial fishing in the Gulf of Maine and adjacent areas. The data are analyzed to characterize factors affecting the spatial and temporal distribution of measures of economic productivity and fishing effort. The analysis consisted of four components: (1) estimation of net revenue at the 10-min square level by season and gear; (2) assessment of variability for catch revenue and catch per unit effort; (3) mapping net revenue and variability in the study area; and (4) estimation of interactions among catch, effort, season, and gear type. The results indicated that, at each location, average fishing efforts exhibited a positive response to increases in expected revenues and a negative response to variability in revenues. Most of the variability in catch revenue can be explained by changes in fishing effort, implying that the spatial patterns of fishery resources are relatively stable at the 10-min square level. An important conclusion is that a spatial scale of at least the 10-min square is appropriate for undertaking MSP involving allocations of commercial fisheries.},

During the past two decades, however, this decline has reversed in various island countries. Today CBMRM continues to grow, refuting the claim that traditional non-Western attitudes toward nature cannot provide a sound foundation for contemporary natural resource management. Limited entry, marine protected areas, closed areas, closed seasons, and restrictions on damaging or overly efficient fishing methods are some of the methods being used. Factors contributing to the upsurge include a growing perception of scarcity, the restrengthening of traditional village-based authority, and marine tenure by means of legal recognition and government support, better conservation education, and increasingly effective assistance, and advice from regional and national governments and NGOs. Today's CBMRM is thus a form of cooperative management, but one in which the community still makes and acts upon most of the management decisions.},

We use a {$\beta\delta$}-model to identify discounting and present bias. Divers had a mean individual discount factor (IDF) of 0.91, significantly higher than fishers' mean of 0.82. Fishers and divers had similar distributions of IDFs and present bias; overall 66\% of interviewees were non-biased, 22\% future-biased, and 12\% present-biased. IDFs and present bias were able to predict management preferences after controlling for demographic factors. However, the effect of discount factors is unique to divers, and the effect of present bias is concentrated among fishers on Cura{\c c}ao. Differences in time preferences between fishers and divers should be considered when developing management strategies. Transfer payments from the dive industry could facilitate a transition to sustainable fishing practices. Establishing property rights alone may not be sufficient for ensuring sustainability if fishers are present-biased and greatly discount the future.},

  abstract = {The addition of juveniles to marine populations (termed ``recruitment'') is highly variable due to variability in the survival of fish through larval and juvenile stages. Recruitment estimates are often large or small for several years in a row (termed ``autocorrelated'' recruitment). Autocorrelated recruitment can be due to numerous factors, but typically is attributed to multi-year environmental drivers affecting early life survival rates. Estimating the magnitude of recruitment autocorrelation within a stock assessment model and examinations on its effect on the quality of forecasts of spawning biomass within stock assessments is uncommon. We used a simulation experiment to evaluate the estimability of autocorrelation within a stock assessment model over a range of levels of autocorrelation in recruitment deviations. The precision and accuracy of estimated autocorrelation, and the ability of an integrated age-structured stock assessment framework to forecast the dynamics of the system, were compared for scenarios where the autocorrelation parameter within the assessment was fixed at zero, fixed at its true value, internally estimated within the integrated model, or input as a fixed value determined using an external estimation procedure that computed the sample autocorrelation of estimated recruitment deviations. Internal estimates of autocorrelation were biased toward extreme values (i.e., towards 1.0 when true autocorrelation was positive and -1.0 when true autocorrelation was negative). Estimates of autocorrelation obtained from the external estimation procedure were nearly unbiased. Forecast performance was poor (i.e., true biomass outside the predictive interval for the forecasted biomass) when autocorrelation was ignored, but was non-zero in the simulation. Applying the external estimation procedure generally improved forecast performance by decreasing forecast error and improving forecast interval coverage. However, estimates of autocorrelation were shown to degrade when fewer than 40 years of recruitment estimates were available.},

  abstract = {To predict recreational-fishing impacts on freshwater fish species, it is important to understand the interplay between fish populations, anglers and management actions. We use an integrated bioeconomic model to study the importance of fish life-history type (LHT) for determining (i) vulnerability to over-exploitation by diverse angler types (generic, consumptive and trophy anglers), who respond dynamically to fishing-quality changes; (ii) regulations [i.e., minimum-size limits (MSLs) and licence densities] that maximize the social welfare of angler populations; and (iii) biological and social conditions resulting under such socially optimal regulations. We examine five prototypical freshwater species: European perch (Perca fluviatilis), brown trout (Salmo trutta), pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), pike (Esox lucius) and bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus). We find that LHT is important for determining the vulnerability of fish populations to overfishing, with pike, pikeperch, and bull trout being more vulnerable than perch and brown trout. Angler type influences the magnitude of fishing impacts, because of differences in fishing practices and angler-type-specific effects of LHT on angling effort. Our results indicate that angler types are systematically attracted to particular LHTs. Socially optimal minimum-size limits generally increase with LHT vulnerability, whereas optimal licence densities are similar across LHTs. Yet, both regulations vary among angler types. Despite this variation, we find that biological sustainability occurs under socially optimal regulations, with one exception. Our results highlight the importance of jointly considering fish diversity, angler diversity and regulations when predicting sustainable management strategies for recreational fisheries. Failure to do so could result in socially suboptimal management and/or fishery collapse.},

In order to develop effective household demand management programs, water managers need to understand the factors that influence household water use. Following an examination and re-analysis of current water consumption behavioral models we propose a new model for understanding household water consumption. We argue that trust plays a role in household water consumption, since people will not save water if they feel others are not minimizing their water use (inter-personal trust). Furthermore, people are less likely to save water if they do not trust the water authority (institutional trust). This paper proposes that to fully understand the factors involved in determining household water use the impact of trust on water consumption needs investigation.},

Killer whales and white sharks are prominent upper trophic level predators with highly-overlapping niches, yet their ecological interactions and subsequent effects have remained obscure. Using long-term electronic tagging and survey data we reveal rare and cryptic interactions between these predators at a shared foraging site, Southeast Farallon Island (SEFI). In multiple instances, brief visits from killer whales displaced white sharks from SEFI, disrupting shark feeding behavior for extended periods at this aggregation site. As a result, annual predations of pinnipeds by white sharks at SEFI were negatively correlated with close encounters with killer whales. Tagged white sharks relocated to other aggregation sites, creating detectable increases in white shark density at Ano Nuevo Island. This work highlights the importance of risk effects and intraguild relationships among top ocean predators and the value of long-term data sets revealing these consequential, albeit infrequent, ecological interactions.},

Estimating EAF indicators from scientific trawl surveys: theoretical and practical concerns. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 796\textendash{}806. Under the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), there is keen interest in providing insights into the evolution of exploited ecosystems using simple ecosystem indicators. Many nations have long-term scientific research surveys, originally driven by conventional approaches in fisheries assessment and management. The aim of this study is to address the practical concerns linked to current objectives of monitoring simple EAF indicators, using data from surveys that were not historically designed for the purpose. Based on the results of an expert survey designed to collect expert knowledge on research surveys from scientists working on different ecosystems worldwide, a list of challenges faced during indicator estimation is highlighted, along with associated concerns and constraints. The work provides additional information useful in the interpretation of the results obtained on the state and trends of ecosystems using EAF indicators by the IndiSeas WG. Further, the related discussion provides potential pathways that could be useful for future research and development aiming to improve the ecosystem indicator approach in the operational context of EAF. The question of the utility for EAF of using historical dataseries of scientific trawl series is also discussed. Such long-term series are concluded to be useful, that they are even inescapable (since the past cannot be resamplied), and that EAF therefore brings a supplementary reason for continuing such monitoring and to incorporate new insights in how research surveys may be conducted.},

We evaluated the progress of tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (tRFMOs) in implementing the ecological component of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). We first developed a best case tRFMO for EBFM implementation. Second, we developed criteria to evaluate progress in applying EBFM against this best case tRFMO. We assessed progress of the following four ecological components: target species, bycatch species, ecosystem properties and trophic relationships, and habitats. We found that many of the elements necessary for an operational EBFM are already present, yet they have been implemented in an ad hoc way, without a long-term vision and a formalized plan. Overall, tRFMOs have made considerable progress monitoring the impacts of fisheries on target species, moderate progress for bycatch species, and little progress for ecosystem properties and trophic relationships and habitats. The tRFMOs appear to be halfway towards implementing the ecological component of EBFM, yet it is clear that the ``low-hanging fruit'' has been plucked and the more difficult, but surmountable, issues remain, notably the sustainable management of bycatch. All tRFMOs share the same challenge of developing a formal mechanism to better integrate ecosystem science and advice into management decisions. We hope to further discussion across the tRFMOs to inform the development of operational EBFM plans.},

  abstract = {Tunas and their relatives dominate the world's largest ecosystems and sustain some of the most valuable fisheries. The impacts of fishing on these species have been debated intensively over the past decade, giving rise to divergent views on the scale and extent of the impacts of fisheries on pelagic ecosystems. We use all available age-structured stock assessments to evaluate the adult biomass trajectories and exploitation status of 26 populations of tunas and their relatives (17 tunas, 5 mackerels, and 4 Spanish mackerels) from 1954 to 2006. Overall, populations have declined, on average, by 60\% over the past half century, but the decline in the total adult biomass is lower (52\%), driven by a few abundant populations. The trajectories of individual populations depend on the interaction between life histories, ecology, and fishing pressure. The steepest declines are exhibited by two distinct groups: the largest, longest lived, highest value temperate tunas and the smaller, short-lived mackerels, both with most of their populations being overexploited. The remaining populations, mostly tropical tunas, have been fished down to approximately maximum sustainable yield levels, preventing further expansion of catches in these fisheries. Fishing mortality has increased steadily to the point where around 12.5\% of the tunas and their relatives are caught each year globally. Overcapacity of these fisheries is jeopardizing their long-term sustainability. To guarantee higher catches, stabilize profits, and reduce collateral impacts on marine ecosystems requires the rebuilding of overexploited populations and stricter management measures to reduce overcapacity and regulate threatening trade.},

We find that where customary governance is still strongly respected and enabled through national legislation, ILSM in practice can be very effective at restricting access and use according to fluctuations in resource availability. However, decision-making under customary governance systems may be vulnerable to mismanagement. Government-led ILSM processes have the potential to design management actions that address the spatial scale of ecosystem processes and threats within the context of national policy and legislation, but may not fully capture broad stakeholder interests, and implementation may be poorly coordinated across highly dispersed island archipelagos. Private sector partnerships offer unique opportunities for resourcing island ILSM, although these are highly likely to be geared towards private sector interests that may change in the future and no longer align with community and/or national objectives. We identify consistent challenges that arise during island ILSM planning and implementation and offer recommendations for improvement.},

While such systems work for certain habitat-specific and nonmobile species, their utility for highly mobile stocks is questionable. Often the debate among proponents and critics of MPAs is confused by a lack of appreciation of the goals and objectives of such systems. The current consideration of MPAs as the basis of future fisheries management is a symptom of, and not the singular solution to, the problem of inappropriate implementation of fishing effort controls. The latter will provide greater overall conservation benefits if properly applied. Any future use of MPAs as an effective tool to achieve sustainable fisheries management in temperate systems should be treated as a large-scale, rigorously designed experiment to ensure that the outcome of using MPAs is interpreted correctly and not discredited for false reasons., Les {\'e}checs r{\'e}p{\'e}t{\'e}s qui se produisent dans l'am{\'e}nagement des p{\^e}ches marines ont incit{\'e} certains {\`a} avancer que les zones de protection marine (MPA) sont la solution pour l'obtention de p{\^e}ches durables.

A wide variety of methods are employed by environmental managers to determine areas of conservation priority, however which methods should be applied is often a subject of debate for practitioners and scientists. We applied two species vulnerability assessments, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species and FishBase's intrinsic vulnerability assessment, to fish communities in three coastal habitats (mangrove, rocky and coral) on the island of San Cristobal, Galapagos. When using the IUCN red list of threatened species, rocky reefs hosted the greatest number of vulnerable species, however when applying the FishBase assessment of intrinsic vulnerability mangroves hosted the greatest abundance of `very-highly' vulnerable species and coral ecosystems hosted the greatest abundance of `highly' vulnerable species. The two methods showed little overlap in determining habitat types that host vulnerable species because they rely on different biological and ecological parameters. Since extensive data is required for IUCN red list assessments, we show that the intrinsic vulnerability assessment from FishBase can be used to complement the IUCN red list especially in data-poor areas. Intrinsic vulnerability assessments are based on less data-intensive methods than the IUCN red list, but nonetheless may bridge information gaps that can arise when using the IUCN red list alone. Vulnerability assessments based on intrinsic factors are not widely applied in marine spatial planning, but their inclusion as a tool for forming conservation strategies can be useful in preventing species loss.},

Modeling the expected responses of targeted species to an MPA network, with a clear timeline for those expectations, can aid in the development of a monitoring program that efficiently evaluates expectations over appropriate time frames. Here, we describe the expected trajectories in abundance and biomass following MPA implementation for populations of 19 nearshore fishery species in California. To capture the process of filling in the age structure truncated by fishing, we used age-structured population models with stochastic larval recruitment to predict responses to MPA implementation. We implemented both demographically open (high larval immigration) and closed (high self-recruitment) populations to model the range of possible trajectories as they depend on recruitment dynamics. From these simulations, we quantified the time scales over which anticipated increases in abundance and biomass inside MPAs would become statistically detectable. Predicted population biomass responses range from little change, for species with low fishing rates, to increasing by a factor of nearly seven, for species with high fishing rates before MPA establishment. Increases in biomass following MPA implementation are usually greater in both magnitude and statistical detectability than increases in abundance. For most species, increases in abundance would not begin to become detectable for at least 10 years after implementation. Overall, these results inform potential indicator metrics (biomass), potential indicator species (those with a high fishing : natural mortality ratio), and time frame ({$>$}10 yr) for MPA monitoring assessment as part of the adaptive management process.},

By assuming that movement is a correlated random walk, we derive a formula that relates expected square displacements to the number of consecutive moves. We show this displacement formula can be used to highlight the consequences of different searching behaviors (i.e. different probability distributions of turning angles or move lengths). Observations of Pieris rapae (cabbage white butterfly) flight and Battus philenor (pipe-vine swallowtail) crawling are analyzed as a correlated random walk. The formula that we derive aptly predicts that net displacements of ovipositing cabbage white butterflies. In other circumstances, however, net displacements are not well-described by our correlated random walk formula; in these examples movement must represent a more complicated process than a simple correlated random walk. We suggest that progress might be made by analyzing these more complicated cases in terms of higher order markov processes.},

Here, we present an updated global surface temperature analysis that reveals that global trends are higher than those reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, especially in recent decades, and that the central estimate for the rate of warming during the first 15 years of the 21st century is at least as great as the last half of the 20th century. These results do not support the notion of a ``slowdown'' in the increase of global surface temperature.
Walking back talk of the end of warming
Previous analyses of global temperature trends during the first decade of the 21st century seemed to indicate that warming had stalled. This allowed critics of the idea of global warming to claim that concern about climate change was misplaced. Karl et al. now show that temperatures did not plateau as thought and that the supposed warming ``hiatus'' is just an artifact of earlier analyses. Warming has continued at a pace similar to that of the last half of the 20th century, and the slowdown was just an illusion.

In this study, we calculate a number of size-based indicators for the Haitian fishery at the remote Navassa Island, where a reef fish visual census (RVC) data set is available over an 8-year study period (2002\textendash{}2009). We also calculate the slope of the size spectrum indicator within a Bayesian framework, which allows for potential biases inherent in the RVC method to be accounted for in credibility intervals around parameter estimates. Results of our analyses suggest that stocks targeted by traps declined from 2002 to 2004, followed by a period of increase from 2006 to 2009. The slope of the size spectrum declined from 2002 to 2004 and remained constant for the remainder of the study period, and this pattern was driven by a decrease in abundance of larger species targeted by hook-and-line. Analysis of the Lmax spectrum also indicated a decrease in the occurrence rates of larger species throughout the study period. Our methods can be applied to fisheries in other areas where limited fishery-independent data and no fishery-dependent data are available.},

  abstract = {We investigated the effects of marine reserve protection on fish and benthic communities at Glover's Reef Marine Reserve, Belize, using a broad suite of indicators. Responses of fish species to protection were highly variable, and therefore indicators calculated at the fish community level were ambiguous. According to 11 of 13 community-level indicators, sites located within the no-take zone fared more poorly over time than did sites in the surrounding fished area. However, we were able to detect positive reserve effects using a newly-proposed pair of indicators, which take into account spatial distribution of different species at the time of the no-take zone implementation. These indicators showed that species subject to low fishing pressure increased inside and to a lesser extent outside the no-take zone, while species subject to higher levels of fishing pressure increased in the no-take zone but decreased in the fished area. Indicators of changes in the fish community were not correlated with those related to the benthic community, and we suggest that indicators be carefully selected to match management objectives. We also find that positive reserve effects based on present-day data (e.g., higher abundances of commercial species inside the no-take zone versus outside) were often not associated with increases in fish densities over time, and suggest caution when interpreting abundance patterns in the absence of historical data. We recommend that similar studies be carried out at a variety of reserve sites, to test our proposed indicators and increase our understanding of community-level responses to fisheries closures.},

  abstract = {Human activity influences wildlife. However, the ecological and conservation significances of these influences are difficult to predict and depend on their population-level consequences. This difficulty arises partly because of information gaps, and partly because the data on stressors are usually collected in a count-based manner (e.g., number of dead animals) that is difficult to translate into rate-based estimates important to infer population-level consequences (e.g., changes in mortality or population growth rates). However, ongoing methodological developments can provide information to make this transition. Here, we synthesize tools from multiple fields of study to propose an overarching, spatially explicit framework to assess population-level consequences of anthropogenic stressors on terrestrial wildlife. A key component of this process is using ecological information from affected animals to upscale from count-based field data on individuals to rate-based demographic inference. The five steps to this framework are (1) framing the problem to identify species, populations, and assessment parameters; (2) field-based measurement of the effect of the stressor on individuals; (3) characterizing the location and size of the populations of interest; (4) demographic modeling for those populations; and (5) assessing the significance of stressor-induced changes in demographic rates. The tools required for each of these steps are well developed, and some have been used in conjunction with each other, but the entire group has not previously been unified together as we do in this framework. We detail these steps and then illustrate their application for two species affected by different anthropogenic stressors. In our examples, we use stable hydrogen isotope data to infer a catchment area describing the geographic origins of affected individuals, as the basis to estimate population size for that area. These examples reveal unexpectedly greater potential risks from stressors for the more common and widely distributed species. This work illustrates key strengths of the framework but also important areas for subsequent theoretical and technical development to make it still more broadly applicable.},

We found significant differences in the bigeye tuna catch per fish aggregating device (FAD) between the eastern group and the western group. We also estimated that the eastern group achieved a higher catch of bigeye tuna because of their increased fishing effort using FAD in the eastern area where there is a higher catch per unit effort for FAD. The regression analysis found significant correlations between the annual catch of bigeye tuna and the number of FAD sets. The average catch of bigeye tuna per single FAD set, estimated from the slope of the regression line, was 7.1 t in the eastern area and 2.7 t in the western area. An impact and risk plot composed of the slope of the regression line and the catch of bigeye tuna by each individual CCM was developed to improve management measures.

In this study, we measured mean effects of reserves and the influence of distance from reserve borders on the number and size of legal ({$\geq$}82.5 mm carapace length [CL]) California spiny lobster Panulirus interruptus trapped at sites across a reserve network at the Santa Barbara Channel Islands, California, USA. Additionally, we controlled for habitat variability across sites (1) by measuring relative abundance of sublegal adult lobsters (i.e. those not removed through fishing) and (2) through visual SCUBA surveys on which we quantified fine-scale habitat features. Traps placed in reserves yielded more (4.81 trap-1) and larger (7.03 mm CL) legal-sized lobsters than traps placed outside. Multiple linear regression revealed that 2.43 more legal lobsters per trap were captured for every 1 km moved from borders towards reserve centers. Additionally, lobsters tagged and released immediately inside reserve borders were recaptured in areas open to fishing at a higher rate than lobsters tagged and released farther inside reserves. These results suggest that abundance gradients inside reserve borders were caused by net emigration of lobsters (spillover). Sublegal lobsters were more abundant inside reserves and nearer to reserve centers, but these increases were much smaller in magnitude than for legal-sized lobsters. Our results indicate that the differences we observed for legal-sized lobsters were driven primarily by reserve effects but were partially influenced by habitat heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Sesame Street is one of the largest early childhood interventions ever to take place. It was introduced in 1969 as an educational, early childhood program with the explicit goal of preparing preschool age children for school entry. Millions of children watched a typical episode in its early years. Well-designed studies at its inception provided evidence that watching the show generated an immediate and sizeable increase in test scores. In this paper we investigate whether the first cohorts of preschool children exposed to Sesame Street experienced improved outcomes subsequently. We implement an instrumental variables strategy exploiting limitations in television technology generated by distance to a broadcast tower and UHF versus VHF transmission to distinguish counties by Sesame Street reception quality. We relate this geographic variation to outcomes in Census data including grade-for-age status in 1980, educational attainment in 1990, and labor market outcomes in 2000. The results indicate that Sesame Street accomplished its goal of improving school readiness; preschool-aged children in areas with better reception when it was introduced were more likely to advance through school as appropriate for their age. This effect is particularly pronounced for boys and non-Hispanic, black children, as well as children living in economically disadvantaged areas. The evidence regarding the impact on ultimate educational attainment and labor market outcomes is inconclusive.},

  abstract = {Reference points based on fishing mortality (F) and spawning stock biomass (SSB) are a requirement of many fisheries management frameworks. SSB is assumed to be a proxy for stock reproductive potential (SRP). Limit reference points based on SSB are used to indicate the level of biomass below which productivity is affected. SSB fails to account for changes in fecundity, egg viability and sex ratio, and it has been argued that total egg production (TEP) provides a better reflection of SRP. We explore how accounting for TEP impacts limit reference points and evidence for a relationship between stock and recruit. Time series of SSB and TEP are compared for three North Sea stocks: cod (Gadus morhua), herring (Clupea harengus) and plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Dynamics based on TEP are different from those based on SSB for cod and plaice, but the stock\textendash{}recruit relationships were not `improved' using TEP. Shifts in productivity (spawner per recruit) occur in all three time series and SSB underestimated uncertainty. Yet again, it was shown that assumptions of stationarity about fish population productivity are incorrect. We argue that the use of TEP does improve the realism in our understanding of stock dynamics, and demographically, more complex management strategy evaluation is required to develop management procedures that are robust to uncertainty and integrate F and the demographic health of a stock. Empirical feedback control systems based on fisheries independent indices including surveys of eggs, larvae, recruits, juveniles or spawning adults should be evaluated and compared to traditional approaches.},

  abstract = {Throughout the world ``fishing the line'' is a frequent harvesting tactic in communities where no-take marine reserves are designated. This practice of concentrating fishing effort at the boundary of a marine reserve is predicated upon the principle of spillover, the net export of stock from the marine reserve to the surrounding unprotected waters. We explore the consequences and optimality of fishing the line using a spatially explicit theoretical model. We show that fishing the line: (1) is part of the optimal effort distribution near no-take marine reserves with mobile species regardless of the cooperation level among harvesters; (2) has a significant impact on the spatial patterns of catch per unit effort (CPUE) and fish density both within and outside of the reserve; and (3) can enhance total population size and catch simultaneously under a limited set of conditions for overexploited populations. Additionally, we explore the consequences of basing the spatial distribution of fishing effort for a multispecies fishery upon the optimality of the most mobile species that exhibits the greatest spillover. Our results show that the intensity of effort allocated to fishing the line should instead be based upon more intermediate rates of mobility within the targeted community. We conclude with a comparison between model predictions and empirical findings from a density gradient study of two important game fish in the vicinity of a no-take marine-life refuge on Santa Catalina Island, California (USA). These results reveal the need for empirical studies to account for harvester behavior and suggest that the implications of spatial discontinuities such as fishing the line should be incorporated into marine-reserve design.},

If dispersal is by random movement, populations within the reserve must be regulated by density-dependent population growth (DDG). Density-dependent movement (DDM) can also regulate the population if accelerated emigration from a reserve to the surrounding fishing grounds leads to substantially increased mortality. Using spatially explicit models, we show that stock per unit area is bounded for DDG and increases with size for DDM. With DDG, spillover rate per unit area of reserve is maximized with reserves around 50\% larger in linear dimension than the minimum size for population persistence. With DDM, spillover per unit area of reserve increases with reserve size. The results highlight the need for the mechanism of population regulation to be incorporated into theoretical and empirical investigations of marine reserve ecology.},

Each is applied to 13 example populations for which well-founded estimates are available of both M and the estimators' parameters. None of the 30 can provide accurate estimates for every species, and none appears sufficiently precise for use in analytical stock assessments, while several perform so poorly as to have no practical utility. If the growth coefficient K has been reliably estimated, either M = 1.5 K or Pauly's long-established estimator can provide useful estimates of M, but they fail with species that have long adult lives after swift juvenile growth, with those that never reach their asymptotic lengths and with species that otherwise deviate from archetypal teleost life histories. If a pre-exploitation maximum observed age (Tmax) can be established, M can be estimated for both teleosts and sharks using M = 4.3/Tmax but that seriously underestimates when the effective sample size (ne) is large and overestimates with species showing pronounced senescence. The new estimator presented here addresses ne but is upset by even mild senescence. Some estimators of M-at-size, particularly ones recently advanced by Gislason et al. and Charnov et al., also show promise but require further examination. It is recommended that fisheries scientists measure M by more advanced methods whenever possible. If `information-limited' estimators must be used, their uncertainties should be acknowledged and their errors propagated into management advice.},

  abstract = {Ecologists are increasingly turning to observational datasets to address hypotheses at large spatial and temporal scales. It is well understood (although often observed in the breach) that applying conventional biometric techniques to such data does not provide causally robust conclusions of the sort obtained from well-designed experiments. Potential pitfalls include omitted variables (which may have causal impacts on both variables being measured and create the correlation between them) and reverse (or even bi-directional) causality. While students are taught that correlation does not imply causation, they are not taught that, regardless of questions of causality, processes such as omitted variables and bidirectional causality can also severely bias the parameter estimates from regressions on observational data; measurement error in the predictor variables can do the same thing, even in a controlled experiment. One solution to this problem is the method of Instrumental Variables (IV), used primarily by social scientists (especially economists). In this chapter I describe the method and show how it can be used to analyze natural experiments, untangle life-history tradeoffs in unmanipulated populations, and analyze time series data subject to measurement error. The method is technically straightforward; the challenge is in identifying a variable that will serve as a suitable instrument. I describe the qualities of good instruments and give some examples.},

  abstract = {Systematic conservation planning has a substantial theoretical underpinning that allows optimization of tradeoffs between biodiversity conservation and other socioeconomic goals. However, this theory assumes perfect spatial information about the locations of biodiversity features (e.g., species distributions). In practice, planners represent well-known taxa and other biodiversity ``surrogates'' in protected area systems, hoping that unmapped species will also be conserved. However, empirical research finds that surrogates predict species presence imperfectly, and sometimes rather poorly, at scales relevant to planning, and existing theory provides no further guidance. We developed new theory, explicitly incorporating aspects of spatial scale, for the representation problem when the locations of species distributions are unknown. Using probability theory and simulated and real species distributions, we found that the probability of adequately representing an unmapped species in a protected area system will be low unless the total fraction of the region being protected is larger than the species representation target. Furthermore, successful conservation depended critically on the relative sizes of the species distribution and of the individual protected areas; fewer, larger protected areas allowed the entire species distribution to fall into an unprotected gap. This scale-dependence varied with the configuration of the protected area system, with the conservation objective most likely to be attained if the individual protected areas were hyperdispersed (evenly spaced across the planning region). Using these results, we developed three design principles for representing unmapped species in protected areas: (1) The fraction of the region placed in protected areas should be substantially larger than the species-level representation target; (2) Individual protected areas must be at least one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the unmapped species' distribution; and (3) Protected areas should be evenly dispersed over geographic space. We also performed preliminary investigations of the effects of surrogates and socio-economic cost data on the probability of adequately representing unmapped species, finding that the primary effect of surrogates may simply be to promote hyperdispersion of protected areas across the planning region, and that seeking to minimize opportunity costs gives poorer conservation results than random protected area placement.},

That work was inspired by the valuable fisheries of the region, the recent discovery of the equatorial undercurrent, and the growing realization of the importance of the El Ni{\~n}o phenomenon. Here we review what was learned in that effort, and integrate those findings with work published since then as well as additional diagnoses based on modern data sets.{$<$}br/{$>$}Unlike the central Pacific, where the winds are nearly zonal and the ocean properties and circulation are nearly independent of longitude, the eastern tropical Pacific is distinguished by wind forcing that is strongly influenced by the topography of the American continent. Its circulation is characterized by short zonal scales, permanent eddies and significant off-equatorial upwelling. Notably, the Costa Rica Dome and a thermocline bowl to its northwest are due to winds blowing through gaps in the Central American cordillera, which imprint their signatures on the ocean through linear Sverdrup dynamics. Strong annual modulation of the gap winds and the meridional oscillation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone generates a Rossby wave, superimposed on the direct forcing, that results in a southwestward-propagating annual thermocline signal accounting for major features of observed thermocline depth variations, including that of the Costa Rica Dome, the Tehuantepec bowl, and the ridge-trough system of the North Equatorial Countercurrent (NECC). Interannual variability of sea surface temperature (SST) and altimetric sea surface height signals suggests that the strengthening of the NECC observed in the central Pacific during El Ni{\~n}o events continues all the way to the coast, warming SST (by zonal advection) in a wider meridional band than the equatorially trapped thermocline anomalies, and pumping equatorial water poleward along the coast.{$<$}br/{$>$}The South Equatorial Current originates as a combination of equatorial upwelling, mixing and advection from the NECC, and Peru coastal upwelling, but its sources and their variability remain unresolved. Similarly, while much of the Equatorial Undercurrent flows southeast into the Peru Undercurrent and supplies the coastal upwelling, a quantitative assessment is lacking. We are still unable to put together the eastern interconnections among the long zonal currents of the central Pacific.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, MAPE has the significant disadvantage that it produces infinite or undefined values for zero or close-to-zero actual values. In order to address this issue in MAPE, we propose a new measure of forecast accuracy called the mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE). MAAPE has been developed through looking at MAPE from a different angle. In essence, MAAPE is a slope as an angle, while MAPE is a slope as a ratio, considering a triangle with adjacent and opposite sides that are equal to an actual value and the difference between the actual and forecast values, respectively. MAAPE inherently preserves the philosophy of MAPE, overcoming the problem of division by zero by using bounded influences for outliers in a fundamental manner through considering the ratio as an angle instead of a slope. The theoretical properties of MAAPE are investigated, and the practical advantages are demonstrated using both simulated and real-life data.},

  abstract = {A form of the log-linear model for modelling catch per unit effort (c.p.u.e.) is described which treats the year category as an ANOVA classification. This model allows the calculation of two standardized relative abundance indices: 1) direct interpretation of regression coefficients for the year category, and 2) the usual estimates of c.p.u.e. calculated using standardized effort (adjusted c.p.u.e.). The regression coefficient estimates have advantages in theoretical simplicity and computational convenience.
The model is applied to two trawl-fished populations of Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus) in the northeast Pacific. Catch and effort data from 1953 to 1976 were used to calculate relative abundance indices standardized for gross tonnage, echo sounders with paper recorders, and roller (bobbin) gear. Stock conditions for the two populations have been historically different, and this factor is shown to interact with the impact of technological improvements. In the Queen Charlotte Sound region, where stocks have been and remain in relatively good condition, technological improvements had little measurable effect on catch rates. However, in the west Vancouver Island region, where stocks have been smaller and are now depleted, these same technological improvements (echo sounders with paper recorders and roller gear) doubled the estimated efficiency of vessels.
Due principally to catches by large Japanese and Soviet trawlers, relative abundance indices in both the Charlotte and Vancouver regions registered a sharp decline (50\% and greater) in 1965 to 1968. This decline was particularly severe in the Vancouver region. In the Charlotte region, relative abundance measured by regression coefficient estimates and adjusted c.p.u.e.s were nearly identical; but in the Vancouver region, these estimates differed. Considering the methods used in calculation, it was concluded that this difference was probably due to chance events rather than systematic bias.
The use of a qualifying criterion for selecting data (deleting data for which the catch is below some fixed percentage of the study species) can greatly affect estimates of relative abundance in multi-species fisheries. In the Charlotte region, a qualifying percentage of 25 \% had little effect on relative abundance estimates. But for the Vancouver region, a qualifying percentage of 25 \% significantly lessened the estimated decline in abundance.
In summary, it appears that there is generally an interaction between the effects of technological improvements in a fishing fleet and the condition of fish stocks. It appears that technological improvements sometimes have their greatest measurable impact on fully utilized or depleted stocks. Also, the selection of qualification levels will sometimes be critical when measuring large declines in stock abundance.},

I interpret these various stock-recruitment curves in the context of the stock reduction analysis model recently proposed by Kimura and Tagart, and Kimura, Balsiger, and Ito. Fits to the stock reduction analysis model can provide equilibrium biomass and equilibrium yield curves that are based on delay difference equation population dynamics. Although not generally recognized, the particular family of stock-recruitment curves that is used can strongly affect the conclusions of a stock assessment. Levels of exploitation that appear near optimum under one family of recruitment curves, may force a stock to extinction under another. This problem is explored in an example reassessing a Pacific ocean perch ( Sebastes alutus ) population using the stock reduction analysis model.},

  abstract = {Effective management of fisheries depends on the selectivity of different fishing methods, control of fishing effort and the life history and mating system of the target species. For sex-changing species, it is unclear how the truncation of age-structure or selection of specific size or age classes (by fishing for specific markets) affects population dynamics. We specifically address the consequences of plate-sized selectivity, whereby submature, ``plate-sized'' fish are preferred in the live reef food fish trade. We use an age-structured model to investigate the decline and recovery of populations fished with three different selectivity scenarios (asymptotic, dome-shaped and plate-sized) applied to two sexual systems (female-first hermaphroditism and gonochorism). We parameterized our model with life-history data from Brown-marbled grouper (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus) and Napoleon fish (Cheilinus undulatus). ``Plate-sized'' selectivity had the greatest negative effect on population trajectories, assuming accumulated fishing effort across ages was equal, while the relative effect of fishing on biomass was greatest with low natural mortality. Fishing such sex-changing species before maturation decreased egg production (and the spawning potential ratio) in two ways: average individual size decreased and, assuming plasticity, females became males at a smaller size. Somatic growth rate affected biomass if selectivity was based on size at age because in slow growers, a smaller proportion of total biomass was vulnerable to fishing. We recommend fisheries avoid taking individuals near their maturation age, regardless of mating system, unless catch is tightly controlled. We also discuss the implications of fishing post-settlement individuals on population dynamics and offer practical management recommendations.},

  abstract = {Studies in terrestrial systems suggest that long-distance propagule dispersal is important for landscape pattern and dynamics, but largely inconsequential for local demography. By contrast, in marine systems, dispersal at regional scales may drive local dynamics, because many species may have large mean dispersal distances. To assess variation in marine dispersal scales, we estimated mean dispersal distances from genetic isolation-by-distance slopes. Estimates ranged widely, from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers. Dispersal differed among taxonomic groups (macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish) and among species in different functional groups (e.g., producers and herbivores). Differences in dispersal scale have important implications for marine community dynamics, reserve design, responses to large-scale perturbations, and evolution of interacting species. To place genetic estimates of marine dispersal in context, we compared them to other measures of dispersal in the ocean and to estimates of dispersal on land. Maximum scales of dispersal by sedentary marine species exceeded maximum estimates of terrestrial plant dispersal by at least one to two orders of magnitude. Direct and genetic estimates of terrestrial plant dispersal were comparable to estimates of marine plant dispersal. Rates of marine macroalgal range expansion, however, far exceeded spread rates of terrestrial plants. Terrestrial plant spread rates were more similar to those of short-dispersing marine organisms that lack secondary dispersal by drifting adults. Genetic estimates of dispersal by different functional groups suggest that herbivores typically disperse much farther than their plant resources both on land and in the sea, although the timing, frequency, and consequences of dispersal may differ in the two systems. Terrestrial herbivores have more flexible dispersal behavior than marine organisms that disperse each generation by planktonic transport of larvae. Our results validate some long-standing views about the greater dispersal potential of species in the ocean, but also highlight the extreme heterogeneity in dispersal scale among marine species. As a result, development of a community perspective on marine connectivity will require consideration of multiple dispersal mechanisms and scales.},

  abstract = {Benthic marine organisms are characterized by a bipartite life history in which populations of sedentary adults are connected by oceanic transport of planktonic propagules. In contrast with the terrestrial case, where `long distance dispersal' (LDD) has traditionally been viewed as a process involving rare events, this creates the possibility for large numbers of offspring to travel far relative to the spatial scale of adult populations. As a result, the concept of LDD must be examined carefully when applied in a marine context. Any measure of LDD requires reference to an explicit `local' scale, often defined in terms of adult population demography, habitat patchiness, or the average dispersal distance. Terms such as `open' and `closed' are relative, and should be used with caution, especially when compared across different taxa and systems. We use recently synthesized data on marine propagule dispersal potential and the spread of marine invasive species to draw inferences about average and maximum effective dispersal distances for marine taxa. Foremost, our results indicate that dispersal occurs at a wide range of scales in marine communities. The nonrandom distribution of these scales among community members has implications for marine community dynamics, and for the implementation of marine conservation efforts. Second, in agreement with theoretical results, our data illustrate that average and extreme dispersal scales do not necessarily covary. This further confounds simple classifications of `short' and `long' dispersers, because different ecological processes (e.g. range expansion vs. population replenishment) depend on different aspects of the dispersal pattern (e.g. extremes vs. average). Our findings argue for a more rigorous quantitative view of scale in the study of marine dispersal processes, where relative terms such as `short' and `long', `open' and `closed', `retained' and `exported' are defined only in conjunction with explicit definitions of the scale and process of interest. This shift in perspective represents an important step towards unifying theoretical and empirical studies of dispersal processes in marine and terrestrial systems.},

  abstract = {Three alternative forms of the spawner-recruit relationship \textendash{} the Beverton-Holt and two expressions of the Ricker function - and a fourth form representing annual recruitment deviations without an explicit relationship to spawning biomass, were applied in an integrated assessment model for Antarctic krill. Model data were from the international krill fishery and U.S. AMLR surveys in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) Subarea 48.1, the area around the Antarctic peninsula where the majority of recent fishing for krill has taken place. Sensitivity tests using pre-specified values for the standard deviation of the logarithm of annual recruitment residuals ({$\sigma$}R) and productivity (steepness, h) for the relationship between spawning biomass and subsequent recruitment indicated that neither the Beverton-Holt nor Ricker functions were superior to configurations of the model that did not assume a spawner-recruit relationship. As the predictive power of the spawner-recruit functions was reduced by increasing the value of {$\sigma$}R the fit to the data improved. All the functions fitted the data best when {$\sigma$}R was large enough so that random recruitment with respect to spawning biomass was produced. The alternative functions produced the same time series of recruitment and spawning biomass estimates when they were determined by the data rather than forced towards an assumed relationship. Although the Beverton-Holt and Ricker models were poor predictors of the data, cross-correlations of the recruitment predictions with the spawning biomass predictions from the best models indicated that recruitment was statistically correlated with spawning biomasses in the previous two to four years. The highest correlation (0.58) was with spawning biomass three years previously. Correlations in the reverse direction, with spawning biomass following recruitment were insignificant. These results suggest that recruitment variability does not influence subsequent spawning biomass in krill. They leave open the possibility that krill spawning biomass could influence subsequent recruitment, but not as modeled in the Beverton-Holt or Ricker functions with a one-year lag and the pre-specified von Bertalanffy growth.},

However, there is relatively limited understanding of the mechanisms that promote information uptake and use in decision-making and planning across a range of water management approaches. We use qualitative and quantitative data to explore the role of different (1) institutions and water governance regimes and (2) knowledge support systems in shaping climate information use in the United States (U.S.) and Brazil. We argue that climate knowledge use among water managers is critically influenced by both the kind of water regime shaping governance\textemdash{}in this case IWRM and conventional approaches\textemdash{}and by the presence and character of knowledge systems producing and brokering climate information. In the cases studied, this research finds that, despite the positive influence of IWRM institutions in pushing for climate information use, other factors such as decision-makers' culture, level of risk averseness and management priorities might be more influential in shaping climate information uptake. Similarly, for conventional management, results suggest that, in Arizona, state planning policies may have played a limited role in advancing climate information use. Overwhelmingly, individual water manager behavior (e.g., information seeking) and risk perception spur consideration of climate information in planning and decision-making. The cases also suggest that more than institutions, it is interaction in the context of an integrated boundary organization that best predicts higher use of climate information by water managers.},

In 2004, after two unsuccessful attempts to implement the MLPA, California created the MLPA Initiative through a memorandum of understanding among two state agencies and a privately-funded foundation that established objectives for a planning process, set out a timeline for deliverables, and established roles and responsibilities for key bodies.

This paper analyzes how recommendations developed through the Initiative supported regulatory decisions by the California Fish and Game Commission to greatly expand the network of marine protected areas. That network includes 124 MPAs, covering 16.0\% of state waters outside of San Francisco Bay, including 9.4\% of state waters in "no-take" areas. Such an extensive network of MPAs that consciously incorporates science-based design guidelines is an important achievement worldwide and is a rare example of a sub-national government creating MPAs.

Successful implementation of formally adopted public policies is well recognized as a complex process critical to achieving policy goals. The Initiative's Blue Ribbon Task Force played a significant role in guiding the planning process to its successful conclusion in providing the State the information it needed to redesign its system of MPAs. Additional elements of the Initiative's success included: effective statutes, adequate funding and professional capacity, robust stakeholder engagement, strong science guidance, effective decision support tools, transparent decision making, and sustained support from top state officials and private foundations.},

Our spatial analysis assesses the geographic distribution of community beneficiaries from the fishery (the ``food shed'' for the fishery), and we document that 20\% of seafood procured from the fishery is used for sociocultural events that are important for social cohesion. This approach provides a method for assessing social, economic, and cultural values provided by small-scale food systems, as well as important contributions to food security, with significant implications for conservation and management.

When populations show dramatic and positive changes in population size, this invariably leads to questions about whether favorable climatic conditions or good management (or both) were responsible. The Barents Sea cod (Gadus morhua) stock has recently increased markedly and the spawning stock biomass is now at an unprecedented high. We identify the crucial social and environmental factors that made this unique growth possible. The relationship between vital rates of Barents Sea cod stock productivity (recruitment, growth, and mortality) and environment is investigated, followed by simulations of population size under different management scenarios. We show that the recent sustained reduction in fishing mortality, facilitated by the implementation of a ``harvest control rule,'' was essential to the increase in population size. Simulations show that a drastic reduction in fishing mortality has resulted in a doubling of the total population biomass compared with that expected under the former management regime. However, management alone was not solely responsible. We document that prevailing climate, operating through several mechanistic links, positively reinforced management actions. Heightened temperature resulted in an increase in the extent of the suitable feeding area for Barents Sea cod, likely offering a release from density-dependent effects (for example, food competition and cannibalism) through prolonged overlap with prey and improved adult stock productivity. Management and climate may thus interact to give a positive outlook for exploited high-latitude marine resources.},

Results show that the average-length-based harvest strategy performs acceptably well for typical Australian demersal temperate trawl species with relatively high productivity. It is essential that the assessment takes the variability in length-at-age into account for this harvest strategy to work effectively.},

This case study examines how the inclusion of women's fishing alters the enumeration of fishers and estimations of catch mass, fishing effort, and targeted organisms in 12 communities in the Central Philippines. Women were 42\% of all fishers and contributed approximately one-quarter of the fishing effort and catch mass.

We considered consumptive and nonconsumptive interests of multiple stakeholders (i.e., fishers, scuba divers, conservationists, managers, scientists) in the systematic design of a network of marine protected areas along California's central coast in the context of the Marine Life Protection Act Initiative. With advice from managers, administrators, and scientists, a representative group of stakeholders defined biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic goals that accommodated social needs and conserved marine ecosystems, consistent with legal requirements. To satisfy biodiversity goals, we targeted 11 marine habitats across 5 depth zones, areas of high species diversity, and areas containing species of special status. We minimized adverse socioeconomic impacts by minimizing negative effects on fishers. We included fine-scale fishing data from the recreational and commercial fishing sectors across 24 fisheries. Protected areas designed with consideration of commercial and recreational fisheries reduced potential impact to the fisheries approximately 21\% more than protected areas designed without consideration of fishing effort and resulted in a small increase in the total area protected (approximately 3.4\%). We incorporated confidential fishing data without revealing the identity of specific fisheries or individual fishing grounds. We sited a portion of the protected areas near land parks, marine laboratories, and scientific monitoring sites to address nonconsumptive socioeconomic goals. Our results show that a stakeholder-driven design process can use systematic conservation-planning methods to successfully produce options for network design that satisfy multiple conservation and socioeconomic objectives.Marine protected areas that incorporate multiple stakeholder interests without compromising biodiversity conservation goals are more likely to protect marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Many studies illustrate variable patterns in individual species distribution shifts in response to changing temperature. However, an assemblage, a group of species that shares a common environmental niche, will likely exhibit similar responses to climate changes, and these community-level responses may have significant implications for ecosystem function. Therefore, we examine the relationship between observed shifts of species in assemblages and regional climate velocity (i.e., the rate and direction of change of temperature isotherms). The assemblages are defined in two sub-regions of the U.S. Northeast Shelf that have heterogeneous oceanography and bathymetry using four decades of bottom trawl survey data and we explore temporal changes in distribution, spatial range extent, thermal habitat area, and biomass, within assemblages. These sub-regional analyses allow the dissection of the relative roles of regional climate velocity and local physiography in shaping observed distribution shifts. We find that assemblages of species associated with shallower, warmer waters tend to shift west-southwest and to shallower waters over time, possibly towards cooler temperatures in the semi-enclosed Gulf of Maine, while species assemblages associated with relatively cooler and deeper waters shift deeper, but with little latitudinal change. Conversely, species assemblages associated with warmer and shallower water on the broad, shallow continental shelf from the Mid-Atlantic Bight to Georges Bank shift strongly northeast along latitudinal gradients with little change in depth. Shifts in depth among the southern species associated with deeper and cooler waters are more variable, although predominantly shifts are toward deeper waters. In addition, spatial expansion and contraction of species assemblages in each region corresponds to the area of suitable thermal habitat, but is inversely related to assemblage biomass. This suggests that assemblage distribution shifts in conjunction with expansion or contraction of thermal habitat acts to compress or stretch marine species assemblages, which may respectively amplify or dilute species interactions to an extent that is rarely considered. Overall, regional differences in climate change effects on the movement and extent of species assemblages hold important implications for management, mitigation, and adaptation on the U.S. Northeast Shelf.},

Within this rapidly evolving field, a promising application is the ability to obtain quantitative estimates of relative species abundance based on eDNA concentration rather than traditionally labor-intensive methods. We investigated the relationship between eDNA concentration and Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) abundance in five well-studied natural lakes; additionally, we examined the effects of different temporal (e.g., season) and spatial (e.g., depth) scales on eDNA concentration. Concentrations of eDNA were linearly correlated with char population estimates ( = 0.78) and exponentially correlated with char densities ( = 0.96 by area; 0.82 by volume). Across lakes, eDNA concentrations were greater and more homogeneous in the water column during mixis; however, when stratified, eDNA concentrations were greater in the hypolimnion. Overall, our findings demonstrate that eDNA techniques can produce effective estimates of relative fish abundance in natural lakes. These findings can guide future studies to improve and expand eDNA methods while informing research and management using rapid and minimally invasive sampling.},

Here we examine the ability to assess the level of exploitation of a data-poor stock based only on information of the size of individuals in catches. The model is a formulation of the classic Beverton\textendash{}Holt theory in terms of size where stock parameters describing growth, natural mortality, recruitment, etc. are determined from life-history invariants. A simulation study was used to compare the reliability of assessments performed under different information availability scenarios, from data-limited, where none of the parameters are known beforehand, to different degrees of information availability cases where one or more parameters are known. If no parameters are known it is possible to correctly assess whether the fishing mortality is below Fmsy in more than 60\% of the cases, and almost always correctly assess whether a stock is subject to overfishing. Adding information about age, i.e., assuming that growth rate and asymptotic size are known, does not improve the estimation. Only knowledge of the ratio between mortality and growth led to a considerable improvement in the assessment. Overall, the simulation study demonstrates that it may be possible to classify a data-poor stock as undergoing over- or under-fishing, while the exact status, i.e., how much the fishing mortality is above or below Fmsy, can only be assessed with a substantial uncertainty. Limitations of the approach are discussed.},

The sector is vulnerable however, and under increasing pressure. The chapter focuses on linking issues of resource conservation in SSFs with governance. It sketches the characteristics of small-scale fisheries and investigated their relationship with conservation and governance, and presents the substantial importance of the sector and its continued numerical growth. The chapter also highlights the lack of data on SSFs, and the fact that in those circumstances many of the recommendations made for SSFs are blindly inherited from the large-scale sector.},

The best estimate of economically recoverable oil in the federal portion of ANWR is 7.06 billion barrels of oil, a quantity roughly equal to US consumption in 2005. The oil is worth \$374 billion (\$2005), but would cost \$123 billion to extract and bring to market. The difference, \$251 billion, would generate social benefits through industry rents of \$90 billion as well as state and federal tax revenues of \$37 billion and \$124 billion, respectively. A contribution of the paper is the decomposition of the benefits between industry rents and tax revenue for a range of price and quantity scenarios. But drilling and development in ANWR would also bring about environmental costs. These costs would consist largely of lost nonuse values for the protected status of ANWR's natural environment. Rather than estimate these costs and conduct a benefit-cost analysis, we calculate the costs that would generate a breakeven result. We find that the average breakeven willingness to accept compensation to allow drilling in ANWR ranges from \$582 to \$1,782 per person, with a mean estimate of \$1,141.},

  abstract = {The emergence of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) has broadened the policy scope of fisheries management by accounting for the biological and ecological connectivity of fisheries. Less attention, however, has been given to the economic connectivity of fisheries. If fishers consider multiple fisheries when deciding where, when, and how much to fish, then management changes in one fishery can generate spillover impacts in other fisheries. Catch-share programs are a popular fisheries management framework that may be particularly prone to generating spillovers given that they typically change fishers' incentives and their subsequent actions. We use data from Alaska fisheries to examine spillovers from each of the main catch-share programs in Alaska. We evaluate changes in participation\textemdash{}a traditional indicator in fisheries economics\textemdash{}in both the catch-share and non\textendash{}catch-share fisheries. Using network analysis, we also investigate whether catch-share programs change the economic connectivity of fisheries, which can have implications for the socioeconomic resilience and robustness of the ecosystem, and empirically identify the set of fisheries impacted by each Alaska catch-share program. We find that cross-fishery participation spillovers and changes in economic connectivity coincide with some, but not all, catch-share programs. Our findings suggest that economic connectivity and the potential for cross-fishery spillovers deserve serious consideration, especially when designing and evaluating EBFM policies.},

As the human population has grown in recent decades, our dependence on ocean-supplied protein has rapidly increased. Kroodsma et al. took advantage of the automatic identification system installed on all industrial fishing vessels to map and quantify fishing efforts across the world (see the Perspective by Poloczanska). More than half of the world's oceans are subject to industrial-scale harvest, spanning an area four times that covered by terrestrial agriculture. Furthermore, fishing efforts seem not to depend on economic or environmental drivers, but rather social and political schedules. Thus, more active measures will likely be needed to ensure sustainable use of ocean resources.
Science, this issue p. 904; see also p. 864
Although fishing is one of the most widespread activities by which humans harvest natural resources, its global footprint is poorly understood and has never been directly quantified. We processed 22 billion automatic identification system messages and tracked {$>$}70,000 industrial fishing vessels from 2012 to 2016, creating a global dynamic footprint of fishing effort with spatial and temporal resolution two to three orders of magnitude higher than for previous data sets. Our data show that industrial fishing occurs in {$>$}55\% of ocean area and has a spatial extent more than four times that of agriculture. We find that global patterns of fishing have surprisingly low sensitivity to short-term economic and environmental variation and a strong response to cultural and political events such as holidays and closures.
More than half of the ocean is exposed to industrial fishing activities.

Whether the globally adopted Aichi Target 11 (10\% ``effective'' protection of national coastal marine areas) can help sustain or rebuild fisheries under such complex conditions is unclear. Based on a systematic theoretic analysis that incorporates previously unavailable data on fish movements, we show that 20\%\textendash{}30\% strict protection of fished habitats is unlikely to harm complex and otherwise unregulated fisheries even if most fish populations are still healthy while providing greater potential to rebuild depleted fisheries and protect biodiversity than the 10\% Aichi target. This finding is important because it suggests that doubling or tripling the only internationally enforced marine reserve target will support biodiversity conservation and higher fisheries productivity where both are most urgently needed.},

Although local evidence suggests that kelp forests are increasingly threatened by a variety of stressors, no comprehensive global analysis of change in kelp abundances currently exists. Here, we build and analyze a global database of kelp time series spanning the past half-century to assess regional and global trends in kelp abundances. We detected a high degree of geographic variation in trends, with regional variability in the direction and magnitude of change far exceeding a small global average decline (instantaneous rate of change = -0.018 y-1). Our analysis identified declines in 38\% of ecoregions for which there are data (-0.015 to -0.18 y-1), increases in 27\% of ecoregions (0.015 to 0.11 y-1), and no detectable change in 35\% of ecoregions. These spatially variable trajectories reflected regional differences in the drivers of change, uncertainty in some regions owing to poor spatial and temporal data coverage, and the dynamic nature of kelp populations. We conclude that although global drivers could be affecting kelp forests at multiple scales, local stressors and regional variation in the effects of these drivers dominate kelp dynamics, in contrast to many other marine and terrestrial foundation species.},

Pressure to meet area-coverage and management effectiveness objectives makes it essential to determine how limited conservation funds should be allocated between expanding protected area networks and better enforcing existing reserves. We formally explore this question for the particular case of an exploited species in a partially protected system, using a general model linking protection, enforcement and legal/illegal resource extraction. We show that, on average, funds should be disproportionately invested in enforcement rather than expansion. Further, expansion alone, without additional enforcement, can actually reduce conservation outcomes. To help guide future decisions, we calculate the optimal allocation of resources between these two actions given any current level of enforcement and protected area coverage. In most cases, simultaneously investing in expansion and enforcement is the optimal decision. However, in places with low enforcement and high protection, protected area contraction, or strategically concentrating enforcement effort, produces the greatest benefits.},

We calculated an impact metric to determine whether countries are protecting proportionally more high- or low-threat ecoregions and compared observed values with random protected-area allocation. We found that protection covered {$<$}2\% of ecoregions in national waters with high levels of abatable threat in 2013, which is {$\sim$}59\% less protection in high-threat areas than if MPAs had been placed randomly. Relatively low-threat ecoregions had 6.3 times more strict protection (International Union for Conservation of Nature categories I\textendash{}II) than high-threat ecoregions. Thirty-one ecoregions had high levels of stoppable threat but very low protection, which presents opportunities for MPAs to yield more significant near-term conservation benefits. The extent of the global MPA estate has increased, but the establishment of MPAs where they can reduce threats that are driving biodiversity loss is now urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Catch shares, where annual catch limits are divided among individuals, communities or cooperatives, are a commonly used fisheries management strategy to increase profits and reduce overcapitalization. Usually these quota shares can be sold or leased, which is theorized to allow for greater utilization of fleet-wide quota. However, this catch-quota balancing may not be achieved in multispecies trawl fisheries where it is difficult to selectively target valuable species while avoiding overfished species. Two similar catch-share-managed, multispecies trawl fisheries were compared to evaluate whether catch shares lead to catch-quota balancing. The U.S. West Coast Groundfish fishery has several species with low total allowable catches (TACs) while the Canadian British Columbia Trawl fishery has comparatively higher TACs. Results indicate that the West Coast fishery had a statistically significant decrease in catch-quota ratios from 0.41 in the three years before catch shares to 0.29 in the three years after catch shares. In contrast, the BC fishery experience no statistically significant change in fishery-wide average catch-quota ratios, which were 0.70 in the three years before and 0.62 in the three years after catch shares. In the West Coast fishery, the risk of exceeding quotas for some species may be so high that fishers are unable to achieve high degrees of catch-quota balancing and instead focus on species that can be easily selected with changes in fishing behavior. Multispecies fisheries management has direct tradeoffs between maximizing yield and achieving conservation goals, and these results may highlight the tradeoff between rebuilding overfished species by reducing TACs, and the achievement of catch-quota balancing.},

To investigate what happens when a trophic cascade pushes a host population over a host-threshold density, I analyzed a 20-year data set of kelp forest communities at 16 sites in the region of the Channel Islands National Park, California, USA. Historically, lobsters, and perhaps other predators, kept urchin populations at low levels and kelp forests developed a community-level trophic cascade. In geographic areas where the main predators on urchins were fished, urchin populations increased to the extent that they overgrazed algae and starvation eventually limited urchin-population growth. Despite the limitation of urchin population size by food availability, urchin densities, at times, well exceeded the host-density threshold for epidemics. An urchin-specific bacterial disease entered the region after 1992 and acted as a density-dependent mortality source. Dense populations were more likely to experience epidemics and suffer higher mortality. Disease did not reduce the urchin population at a site to the density that predators previously did. Therefore, disease did not fully replace predators in the trophic cascade. These results indicate how fishing top predators can indirectly favor disease transmission in prey populations.},

Extensive variability means that economic survival must be a primary consideration in the investment decision process. In this paper, fishermen's investment decisions are modelled as a probabilistic dynamic programming problem in discrete time. Fishermen are assumed to make rational decisions based on income expectations and subject to survivability conditions to maximize the net worth of the fishing enterprise at the end of a finite planning horizon. The formal analysis of the investment model is presented and the model is applied to trailer fishermen of the British Columbia commercial fishing fleet. The results present an accurate picture of actual investment decisions and provide valuable insights into the behavioral basis of investment decision making by fishermen.

  abstract = {Failures in fisheries management have been linked to our inability to embrace the inherent uncertainty of fisheries systems. Fisheries decisions should be made on the basis of integrated evaluations of strategy alternatives, where comparisons of comprehensive scenarios incorporate strategic biological and socio-economic objectives and constraints, and explicitly take account of system uncertainties and evaluated risk. This paper investigates the requirements for integrated decision-making for fisheries systems. It is argued that conceptual change is required, and that such change will form the basis for interdisciplinary studies in ``fisheries management science''. Founded on the principles of decision analysis developed within the field of operational research/management science, the fisheries management science approach provides the requisite methodologies for risk analysis and its components of risk assessment and risk management, and for improved decision support. An illustrative case study based on the herring fishery in NAFO divisions 4WX is used to demonstrate the proposed methodology.},

  abstract = {Today, the tuna fishery of the western and central Pacific is one of the world's largest fisheries. Annual catches exceed 2 million mt\textemdash{}approximately 50\% of the global tuna catch\textemdash{}with an estimated landed value of USD 3 billion (in 2005). The fishery expanded rapidly from the mid 1980s, following the development of the purse-seine fishery. From the mid 1990s, it was recognised that a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation was required to facilitate cooperation in the management of the resource. Following almost a decade of negotiations and planning, the Western and Central Pacific Fishery Commission (WCPFC) was established in 2004. During the interim period, stock assessments for the key tuna species were developed and revealed that for two species (yellowfin and bigeye tuna) there was concern regarding the increased levels of fishing mortality. However, declarations and resolutions calling for restraint in the expansion of fishing effort were largely unheeded over the last decade and, to date, the WCPFC has been unable to introduce any measures to effectively reduce (or limit) the level of fishing mortality on yellowfin and bigeye tuna. This paper proposes a number of mechanisms for improving the performance of the WCPFC with respect to meeting the conservation and management objectives of the commission and argues that Pacific Island nations need to collectively take the lead to ensure the effective management of the resource.},

Defining trends and thresholds in responses of ecological indicators to fishing and environmental pressures. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 755\textendash{}767. Both fishing and environmental forces can influence the structure of marine ecosystems. To further understand marine ecosystems and to implement ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), an evaluation of ecosystem indicators is warranted. In this context, it is particularly important to identify thresholds where fishing and environmental pressures significantly influence ecological indicators. We empirically determined numerical values of environmental forces and fishing pressure that significantly altered the response of ecological indicators for the Northeast Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem. Generalized additive models predicted a non-linear relationship for each pressure\textendash{}response pairing. With this smoother, 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for estimated first and second derivatives for each relationship were determined via parametric bootstrap. A significant trend or threshold was noted when the CI for the first or second derivative was greater or less than zero, delineating the level at which pressure variables influence the rate and direction of ecosystem indicator responses. We identify reference levels where environmental forces and fishing pressure result in ecosystem change by collectively examining the responses of multiple ecological indicators. Individual indicators showed unique responses to pressures, however, similar values for the pressures were associated with significant changes for multiple indicators. These reference levels establish a foundation for implementation of EBFM.},

  abstract = {Randomized experiments have long been the gold standard in determining causal effects in ecological control\textendash{}impact studies. However, it may be difficult to address many ecologically and policy-relevant control\textendash{}impact questions-such as the effect of forest fragmentation or protected areas on biodiversity through experimental manipulation due to scale, costs and ethical considerations. Yet, ecologists may still draw causal insights in observational control\textendash{}impact settings by exploiting research designs that approximate the experimental ideal. Here, we review the challenges of making causal inference in non-experimental control\textendash{}impact scenarios as well as a suite of statistical tools specifically designed to overcome such challenges. These tools are widely used in fields where experimental research is more limited (i.e., medicine, economics), and could be applied by ecologists across numerous sub-disciplines. Using hypothetical examples, we discuss why bias is likely to plague observational control\textendash{}impact studies in ways that do not surface with experimental manipulations, why bias is generally the barrier to causal inference, and different methods to overcome this bias. Satellite-, survey- and citizen\textendash{}science data hold great potential for advancing key questions in ecology that would otherwise be prohibitive to pursue experimentally. However, to harness such data to understand causal impacts of land, environmental and policy changes, we must expand our toolset such that we can improve inference and more confidently advance ecological understanding and science-informed policy.},

  abstract = {Ocean plastic can persist in sea surface waters, eventually accumulating in remote areas of the world's oceans. Here we characterise and quantify a major ocean plastic accumulation zone formed in subtropical waters between California and Hawaii: The Great Pacific Garbage Patch (GPGP). Our model, calibrated with data from multi-vessel and aircraft surveys, predicted at least 79 (45\textendash{}129) thousand tonnes of ocean plastic are floating inside an area of 1.6 million km2; a figure four to sixteen times higher than previously reported. We explain this difference through the use of more robust methods to quantify larger debris. Over three-quarters of the GPGP mass was carried by debris larger than 5\,cm and at least 46\% was comprised of fishing nets. Microplastics accounted for 8\% of the total mass but 94\% of the estimated 1.8 (1.1\textendash{}3.6) trillion pieces floating in the area. Plastic collected during our study has specific characteristics such as small surface-to-volume ratio, indicating that only certain types of debris have the capacity to persist and accumulate at the surface of the GPGP. Finally, our results suggest that ocean plastic pollution within the GPGP is increasing exponentially and at a faster rate than in surrounding waters.},

To address this, the Indian Maharashtra state government recently announced that it will financially compensate fishers who release incidentally captured endangered species. Payment will be made based on photographic evidence of the captured individual and proof that fishing gear was damaged to allow the release ([ 5 ][5]).

Financially incentivizing the release of threatened bycatch considers the needs of fishers and hunters whose actions often have direct consequences for conservation ([ 6 ][7], [ 7 ][8]). As a result of a similar pay-for-release program, Kenyan fishers have released about 17,000 threatened bycaught sea turtles over the past two decades ([ 8 ][9]). This positive outcome underscores clear and measurable conservation gains, yet pay-for-release schemes remain a rarely used conservation strategy.

Instead, tackling the issue of bycatch mostly relies on modifying capture gear, education, and enforcing legislation ([ 1 ][1], [ 2 ][2], [ 9 ][10]), approaches that commonly require long-term investment for positive outcomes ([ 3 ][3], [ 4 ][4], [ 10 ][11]). The pay-for-release strategy could provide a rapid, complementary mechanism to ease pressure on threatened species, such as sawfishes ([ 11 ][12]), that are not the focus of harvest and require immediate conservation action ([ 5 ][5], [ 12 ][13]). The Maharashtra government, and any local governments that follow suit, should explore a broad range of scenarios and collect results to determine the most effective way to implement this type of program and to assess its effectiveness.

  abstract = {Steepness of the stock\textendash{}recruitment relationship is one of the most uncertain and critical quantities in fishery stock assessment and management. Steepness is defined as the fraction of recruitment from a virgin population obtained when the spawners are at 20\% of the virgin level. Steepness directly relates to productivity and yield and is an important element in the calculation of many management reference points. Stock\textendash{}recruitment relationships have traditionally been estimated from time series of recruitment and spawning biomass, but recently interest has arisen regarding the ability to estimate steepness inside fishery stock assessment models. We evaluated the ability to estimate steepness of the Beverton\textendash{}Holt stock\textendash{}recruitment relationship using simulation analyses for twelve US Pacific Coast fish stocks. A high proportion of steepness estimates from the simulated data and the original data occur at the bounds for steepness and the proportion decreased as the true steepness decreased. The simulation results indicate that, in most cases, steepness was estimated with moderate to low precision and moderate to high bias. The poorly estimated steepness indicates that often there is little information in the data about this quantity. However, reliable estimation is attainable with a good contrast of spawning stock biomass for relatively unproductive stocks when the model is correctly specified.},

The age-based process caused bias in the estimates of growth parameters assuming random at length, even when relatively few age classes were affected. Methods that assumed random at age were biased by the subsequent inclusion of the length-based process of gear selection. Additional knowledge of the age structure of the sampled area is needed to ensure an unbiased estimate of the growth parameters when using the length-conditional approach in the presence of age-based movement. Estimates of the variability in the length-at-age relationship were better estimated with the length-conditional than the traditional method even when the assumptions of random at length were violated. Inclusion of paired observations of length and associated age inside the population dynamics model may be the most appropriate way of estimating growth.},

  abstract = {An enhanced version of the spatial ecosystem and population dynamics model SEAPODYM is presented to describe spatial dynamics of tuna and tuna-like species in the Pacific Ocean at monthly resolution over 1\textdegree{} grid-boxes. The simulations are driven by a bio-physical environment predicted from a coupled ocean physical\textendash{}biogeochemical model. This new version of SEAPODYM includes expanded definitions of habitat indices, movements, and natural mortality based on empirical evidences. A thermal habitat of tuna species is derived from an individual heat budget model. The feeding habitat is computed according to the accessibility of tuna predator cohorts to different vertically migrating and non-migrating micronekton (mid-trophic) functional groups. The spawning habitat is based on temperature and the coincidence of spawning fish with presence or absence of predators and food for larvae. The successful larval recruitment is linked to spawning stock biomass. Larvae drift with currents, while immature and adult tuna can move of their own volition, in addition to being advected by currents. A food requirement index is computed to adjust locally the natural mortality of cohorts based on food demand and accessibility to available forage components. Together these mechanisms induce bottom-up and top-down effects, and intra- (i.e. between cohorts) and inter-species interactions. The model is now fully operational for running multi-species, multi-fisheries simulations, and the structure of the model allows a validation from multiple data sources. An application with two tuna species showing different biological characteristics, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus), is presented to illustrate the capacity of the model to capture many important features of spatial dynamics of these two different tuna species in the Pacific Ocean. The actual validation is presented in a companion paper describing the approach to have a rigorous mathematical parameter optimization [Senina, I., Sibert, J., Lehodey, P., 2008. Parameter estimation for basin-scale ecosystem-linked population models of large pelagic predators: application to skipjack tuna. Progress in Oceanography]. Once this evaluation and parameterization is complete, it may be possible to use the model for management of tuna stocks in the context of climate and ecosystem variability, and to investigate potential changes due to anthropogenic activities including global warming and fisheries pressures and management scenarios.},

  abstract = {Indicators are widely promoted as means to monitor ecosystem status or to evaluate fisheries management performance. ``Which indicators are most relevant as decision-support tools in fisheries management?'' still remains a topical question. Indicators should be metrics related to fish populations and fleets and should be sensitive to management strategies. However, given the complexity of the processes involved, it is often difficult to unequivocally interpret variations in metrics. A simulation approach was used to study metric properties and to identify robust and relevant fishery indicators. By applying sensitivity analysis methods, simulation designs were built that cross a variety of management scenarios and uncertainty hypotheses. Bio-economic outputs were simulated using a mechanistic model (ISIS-Fish), and their properties were statistically analyzed. This approach was applied to the pelagic fishery of the Bay of Biscay.

Phycologia 51: 168\textendash{}216. DOI: 10.2216/11-37 Pseudo-nitzschia is a globally distributed diatom genus, some species of which produce domoic acid (DA), the neurotoxin that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning. This toxin killed at least three humans in 1987, launching numerous studies concerning the identification, distribution, ecology and physiology of Pseudo-nitzschia spp. Since previous reviews in 1998, knowledge has been gained about the fate of DA, including its accumulation by marine animals and its degradation by light and bacteria. Molecular techniques and more precise microscopy have enabled the description of new Pseudo-nitzschia species, 15 since 2002, including ones that are cryptic and pseudo-cryptic. An increasing number of the 37 identified species, including oceanic and coastal species, have been studied in laboratory culture. The sexual reproduction of 14 species has been documented. Fourteen species have now been shown to be toxigenic, although some strains are not always toxic under the testing conditions. The biotic and abiotic factors that modify DA production are reviewed, with a focus on how new discoveries have changed our original hypotheses about control mechanisms. Recent studies confirm that silicate and phosphate limitation trigger DA production. However, stress by low concentrations of iron or high concentrations of copper are newly discovered triggers, suggesting a trace-metal chelation role for DA. Organic sources of nitrogen (urea and glutamine), as well as changes in pH, CO2, salinity and bacterial concentration, also enhance DA production. Laboratory and field studies sometimes give divergent results for conditions that are conducive to toxin production. Gaps in knowledge include further information about the whole genome of Pseudo-nitzschia (including sexual stages), mechanisms of DA production and decline, presence or absence of a resting stage, heterotrophic ability, impact of viruses and fungi, and a more complete description of the ecological and physiological roles of DA.},

Overfishing of bigeye tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean has motivated a search for a practical means of reducing the catch of bigeye tuna in mixed species aggregations. To explore the effects of gear characteristics on the catch of bigeye tuna, a classification algorithm for the presence/absence of bigeye tuna catch in purse-seine sets on floating objects is developed, using the tree-based method, random forests. Although the location of the set was the strongest determinant of bigeye tuna catch with these data, bigeye tuna in some areas were more likely to be caught on floating objects with greater underwater depths and with deeper purse-seines. Misclassified sets that caught bigeye tuna were concentrated within certain vessels, suggesting the existence of additional vessel effects. Results indicate that fishers may avoid catching bigeye tuna in some areas by changing the depth of the material hanging from the floating object and the actual fishing depth of the purse-seine, or by moving to other fishing areas. Nonetheless, given the complexity of configuring a purse-seine, and the difficulties associated with monitoring compliance with gear regulations, fishery-wide gear restrictions would be problematic.},

  abstract = {Using benthic habitat data from the Florida Keys (USA), we demonstrate how siting algorithms can help identify potential networks of marine reserves that comprehensively represent target habitat types. We applied a flexible optimization tool\textemdash{}simulated annealing\textemdash{}to represent a fixed proportion of different marine habitat types within a geographic area. We investigated the relative influence of spatial information, planning-unit size, detail of habitat classification, and magnitude of the overall conservation goal on the resulting network scenarios. With this method, we were able to identify many adequate reserve systems that met the conservation goals, e.g., representing at least 20\% of each conservation target (i.e., habitat type) while fulfilling the overall aim of minimizing the system area and perimeter. One of the most useful types of information provided by this siting algorithm comes from an ``irreplaceability analysis,'' which is a count of the number of times unique planning units were included in reserve system scenarios. This analysis indicated that many different combinations of sites produced networks that met the conservation goals. While individual 1-km2 areas were fairly interchangeable, the irreplaceability analysis highlighted larger areas within the planning region that were chosen consistently to meet the goals incorporated into the algorithm. Additionally, we found that reserve systems designed with a high degree of spatial clustering tended to have considerably less perimeter and larger overall areas in reserve\textemdash{}a configuration that may be preferable particularly for sociopolitical reasons. This exercise illustrates the value of using the simulated annealing algorithm to help site marine reserves: the approach makes efficient use of available resources, can be used interactively by conservation decision makers, and offers biologically suitable alternative networks from which an effective system of marine reserves can be crafted.},

  abstract = {We address the conflict in earlier results regarding the relationship between dispersal potential and range size. We examine all published pelagic larval duration data for tropical reef fishes. Larval duration is a convenient surrogate for dispersal potential in marine species that are sedentary as adults and that therefore only experience significant dispersal during their larval phase. Such extensive quantitative dispersal data are only available for fishes and thus we use a unique dataset to examine the relationship between dispersal potential and range size. We find that dispersal potential and range size are positively correlated only in the largest ocean basin, the Indo-Pacific, and that this pattern is driven primarily by the spatial distribution of habitat and dispersal barriers. Furthermore, the relationship strengthens at higher taxonomic levels, suggesting an evolutionary mechanism. We document a negative correlation between species richness and larval duration at the family level in the Indo-Pacific, implying that speciation rate may be negatively related to dispersal potential. If increased speciation rate within a taxonomic group results in smaller range sizes within that group, speciation rate could regulate the association between range size and dispersal potential.},

Economic theory has a long history of evaluating tradeoffs in returns from different assets to identify optimal investment strategies. There has been recent progress applying this framework to the delivery of ecosystem services in land use planning. However, despite growing national and international interest in marine spatial planning, there is a lack of parallel frameworks in the marine realm. This paper reviews an ecosystem service tradeoff analysis framework and provides a more comprehensive synthesis for how it can be applied to marine spatial planning and marine ecosystem-based management. A tradeoff analysis approach can reveal inferior management options, demonstrate the benefits of comprehensive planning for multiple, interacting services over managing single services, and identify `compatible' services that provide win\textendash{}win management options.},

Yet the model sheds light on the economic implications of these conflicts as well as on the implications of other duopolistic situations in which the decisions of the participants affect the evolution of an underlying population of interest. Our model has two basic features: the underlying population changes as a result of the actions of both participants, and each participant takes account of the other's actions. This strategic aspect is studied, for an example, by using the concept of a Cournot-Nash equilibrium in which each participant's reaction depends on the stock of fish and not on previous behavior. Thus, the model is a discrete-time analog of a differential game. The paper examines the dynamic and steady-state properties of the fish population that results from the participants' interactions.},

  abstract = {It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an 'observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging form the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

In such systems, small changes can be magnified through nonlinear interactions, facilitating regime shifts and collapses. Protection of the services these ecosystems provide must therefore maintain the adaptive capacities of these systems by preserving a balance among heterogeneity, modularity, and redundancy, tightening feedback loops to provide incentives for sound stewardship. The challenge for management is to increase incentives to individuals, and tighten reward loops, in ways that will strengthen the robustness and resilience of these systems and preserve their ability to provide ecosystem services for generations to come.},

Despite a growing awareness of bycatch problems in particular ocean regions, there have been few efforts to identify spatial patterns in bycatch events. Furthermore, many studies of fisheries bycatch have been myopic, focusing on a single species or a single region. Using a range of analytical approaches to identify spatial patterns in bycatch data, we demonstrate the utility and applications of area and point pattern analyses to single and multispecies bycatch seascapes of pelagic longline fisheries in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. We find clear evidence of spatial clustering within bycatch species in both ocean basins, both in terms of the underlying pattern of the locations of bycatch events relative to fishing locations and for areas of high bycatch rates. Furthermore, we find significant spatial overlap in the pattern of bycatch across species relative to the spatial distribution in fishing effort and target catch. These results point to the importance of considering spatial patterns of both single and multispecies bycatch to meet the ultimate goal of reducing bycatch encounters. These analyses also highlight the importance of considering bycatch relative to target catch as a way of identifying areas where fishing effort reduction may help to reduce multispecies bycatch with minimal impact on target catch.},

It highlights the importance of incentive-compatibility and self-enforcement and the bargaining problems faced in achieving viable, long-term contracts. We argue that only if the parties to a unitization contract have unit production shares that are the same as their cost shares will the contract be incentive compatible. Using a database of 60 unit operating agreements, we measure the industry's actual behavior against the principles of production from a common pool. Our survey of units that have only one production phase and that are relatively homogeneous reveals that such equal sharing rules are always found and they appear to encourage the parties to behave optimally. In more complex units with multiple production phases and/or separate concentrations of oil and gas (gas caps) we find deviations from the theoretical ideal. In the case of multiphase units, we find equal cost and production shares within phases, but not across phases. A preset trigger for shifting from one production phase to the next helps to maintain optimal behavior. For gas cap units, however, we generally do not find the equal sharing rule. Conflicts and rent dissipation follow as illustrated by the case of the Prudhoe Bay Unit. The article describes the desirable contract rules for avoiding moral hazard. It also shows how the effects of those rules can be replicated in difficult situations.},

More specifically, it may be impossible to identify any plan of unitized development that is not pareto-dominated by initial endowments or other non-unitized production arrangements which the parties might devise. These results cast the role of the regulatory agency in a new light.

These same issues have relevance today 100 years later in face of growing concern about the availability of fresh water worldwide as demand grows and as supplies become more uncertain due to the potential effects of climate change. The central point of this article is that appropriative water rights and irrigation districts that emerged in the American West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in response to aridity to facilitate agricultural water delivery, use, and trade raise the transaction costs today of water markets. These markets are vital for smooth re-allocation of water to higher-valued uses elsewhere in the economy and for flexible response to greater hydrological uncertainty.

There are major differences in water prices across uses (agriculture, urban, environmental) and these differences appear to persist, suggesting that water markets have not developed fully enough to narrow the gaps. Moreover, there is considerable difference in the extent and nature of water trading across the western states, suggesting that water values and transaction costs of trade vary considerably across jurisdictions. I then turn to the resource and political costs of defining water rights and expanding the use of markets. In this discussion, efficiency and equity objectives play important, often conflicting, roles. This tension reflects the very social nature of the water resource.},

The transaction costs of defining the property rights to mitigation benefits and costs is a useful framework for such analysis. This approach views international cooperation as a contractual process among country leaders to assign those property rights. Leaders cooperate when it serves domestic interests to do so. The demand for property rights comes from those who value and stand to gain from multilateral action. Property rights are supplied by international agreements that specify resource access and use, assign costs and benefits including outlining the size and duration of compensating transfer payments and determining who will pay and who will receive them. Four factors raise the transaction costs of assigning property rights: (i) scientific uncertainty regarding mitigation benefits and costs; (ii) varying preferences and perceptions across heterogeneous populations; (iii) asymmetric information; and (iv) the extent of compliance and new entry. These factors are used to examine the role of transaction costs in the establishment and allocation of property rights to provide globally-valued national parks, implement the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), execute the Montreal Protocol to control emissions that damage the stratospheric ozone layer, set limits on harvest of highly-migratory ocean fish stocks, and control greenhouse gas emissions (GHG).},

  abstract = {Since the days of Elton, population cycles have challenged ecologists and resource managers. Although the underlying mechanisms remain debated, theory holds that both density-dependent and density-independent processes shape the dynamics. One striking example is the large-scale fluctuations of sardine and anchovy observed across the major upwelling areas of the world. Despite a long history of research, the causes of these fluctuations remain unresolved and heavily debated, with significant implications for fisheries management. We here model the underlying causes of these fluctuations, using the California Current Ecosystem as a case study, and show that the dynamics, accurately reproduced since A.D. 1661 onward, are explained by interacting density-dependent processes (i.e., through species-specific life-history traits) and climate forcing. Furthermore, we demonstrate how fishing modifies the dynamics and show that the sardine collapse of the 1950s was largely unavoidable given poor recruitment conditions. Our approach provides unique insight into the origin of sardine\textendash{}anchovy fluctuations and a knowledge base for sustainable fisheries management in the California Current Ecosystem and beyond.},

  abstract = {Defining and attaining suitable management goals probably represent the most difficult part of ecosystem-based fisheries management. To achieve those goals we ultimately need to define ecosystem overfishing in a way that is analogous to the concept used in single-species management. Ecosystem-based control rules can then be formulated when various ecosystem indicators are evaluated with respect to fishing-induced changes. However, these multi-attribute control rules will be less straightforward than those applied typically in single-species management, and may represent a gradient rather than binary decision criteria. Some ecosystem-based decision criteria are suggested, based on indicators empirically derived from the Georges Bank, Gulf of Maine ecosystem. Further development in the translation of ecosystem indicators into decision criteria is one of the major areas for progress in fisheries science and management.},

Relating marine ecosystem indicators to fishing and environmental drivers: an elucidation of contrasting responses. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 787\textendash{}795. The usefulness of indicators in detecting ecosystem change depends on three main criteria: the availability of data to estimate the indicator (measurability), the ability to detect change in an ecosystem (sensitivity), and the ability to link the said change in an indicator as a response to a known intervention or pressure (specificity). Here, we specifically examine the third aspect of indicator change, with an emphasis on multiple methods to explore the ``relativity'' of major ecosystem drivers. We use a suite of multivariate methods to explore the relationships between a pre-established set of fisheries-orientated ecosystem status indicators and the key drivers for those ecosystems (particularly emphasizing proxy indicators for fishing and the environment). The results show the relative importance among fishing and environmental factors, which differed notably across the major types of ecosystems. Yet, they also demonstrated common patterns in which most ecosystems, and indicators of ecosystem dynamics are largely driven by fisheries (landings) or human (human development index) factors, and secondarily by environmental drivers (e.g. AMO, PDO, SST). How one might utilize this empirical evidence in future efforts for ecosystem approaches to fisheries is discussed, highlighting the need to manage fisheries in the context of environmental and other human (e.g. economic) drivers.},

  abstract = {The well-documented value of marine fisheries is threatened by overfishing. Management typically focuses on target populations but lacks effective tools to document or restrain overexploitation of marine ecosystems. Here, we present three indices and accompanying thresholds to detect and delineate ecosystem overfishing (EOF): the Fogarty, Friedland, and Ryther indices. These are based on widely available and readily interpreted catch and satellite data that link fisheries landings to primary production using known limits of trophic transfer efficiency. We propose theoretically and empirically based thresholds for each of those indices; with these criteria, several ecosystems are fished sustainably, but nearly 40 to 50\% of tropical and temperate ecosystems exceed even extreme thresholds. Applying these criteria to global fisheries data results in strong evidence for two specific instances of EOF, increases in both pressure on tropical fish and a climate-mediated polar shift. Here, we show that these two patterns represent evidence for global EOF.
Newly derived thresholds show that about half the world's marine ecosystems are experiencing ``ecosystem'' overfishing.

  abstract = {Over the past 8\textendash{}9 fishing seasons, recruitment has declined in all of the major rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) fisheries in south-eastern Australia. This has translated into declines in commercial catch rates. In some regions, this decline has been rapid. For example, catch rate in the southern zone fishery of South Australia has decreased by 65\% from 2.1 kg/potlift in 2002 to 0.73 kg/potlift in 2008. While trends in recruitment and catch rate are spatially similar, contrasting regional signals are observed from puerulus settlement data which are used to predict future recruitment. Settlement has generally decreased in Tasmania, but some of the highest settlements on record were recorded in 2005 and 2006 in South Australia and Victoria. While historical management decisions may have contributed to the current status of rock lobster fisheries in some areas, simultaneous patterns of decline indicate possible large-scale environmental influences. Specific environmental factors remain largely unknown. However, we present data from an exceptional coldwater upwelling event observed during 2008 which suggests that growth rates in South Australia were significantly impacted. Overall, the results highlight the need for conservative TACCs in fisheries across south-eastern Australia in order to protect existing biomass and sustain rock lobster resources.},

  abstract = {Reaction of fishers is an essential source of uncertainty in implementing fishery management decisions. Provided they realistically capture fisher behaviour, models of fishing vessel dynamics provide the basis for evaluating the impact of proposed management strategies. Information flow among vessels has not been a major focus of such models however, although it might play a critical role in how a fleet responds to changes to management restrictions or levels of a resource. Such a response might then modify subsequent exploitation of the resource. In this paper, a spatially-explicit model of vessel fishing behaviour is developed for a line fishery on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Vessel behaviour is conditioned on past catch and effort data at a spatial resolution of 6\texttimes{}6 nautical mile grid cells. For each vessel, the probability of fishing a particular grid cell is determined from past income per unit effort experienced at that location, and the cost of steaming to it. The probability distribution across all possible grid cells represents a particular vessel's perspective. This perspective is modified by information conveyed by other vessels using Bayesian-network information propagation. The information conveyed is the effort distribution of other vessels and is equivalent to a vessel `watching' where other vessels fish. We compare the behaviours that vessels display when they act independently with those they display when they `watch' each other, and show the effect that such information flow can have on a resource. Information flow among fishing vessels can be shown to have an effect on the dynamics and resource exploitation of a simulated fishery.},

  abstract = {A spatially-structured simulation model of the metapopulation dynamics of common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus) and their harvest by line fishing was developed to evaluate potential management options on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), including closing areas to fishing. The effects of line fishing simulator (ELFSim) incorporates a spatially-structured model of the life-history of common coral trout, including larval dispersal, harvest by multiple fishing sectors (commercial, charter and recreational), and a range of mechanisms for regulating harvest. The model is designed to allow considerable flexibility in biological and fishery dynamics, to be portable to contexts other than the GBR, and to be modular to allow comparison of different implementations of biological and harvest model components. In this paper, we describe the details of the model and discuss its utility as a tool for evaluating fishery management strategies in the context of diverse stakeholder expectations. We illustrate a simple application by changing the rate at which larvae settle on the reef from which they were spawned, under a range of spatial closures and a scenario of steadily increasing fishing effort. The results identify the conditions under which a ``larval subsidy effect'' may be important to the performance of fishery management strategies. This effect was manifest as increased catches outside of areas closed to fishing when larvae were freely exchanged among reefs compared to when larval exchange was diminished or absent.},

  abstract = {Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) are increasingly seen as a way to make fisheries more profitable and halt over-capitalisation. ITQs allocate to users of a resource a share of a total allowable catch (TAC) which they are free to use, lease, or sell. We outline an approach to modelling the effect of an ITQ system in a multi-species, multi-sector fishery and apply it to the Coral Reef Fin Fish Fishery (CRFFF) in Queensland, Australia. An ITQ model, based on the assumption that operators seek to maximize profits, simulates the use of tradeable quota units by operators in the fishery, taking account of the initial quota allocation to operators, seasonal fish prices and individual operator variable costs, their fishing efficiency and experience, and constraints on vessel movements. Rationalization of the fishery is predicted to occur under an ITQ system for the CRFFF, which will lead to reductions in effort, increases in profits, and changes over time in quota prices. The ecological consequences of transferable quota in the multi-species fishery are seen in the catch and discard levels of the less profitable species, even though a TAC was set. This had flow-on effects on biomass. For example, simulations showed that the TAC for the primary target species, coral trout, was used more fully than that for a less valuable target species, red throat emperor, and that this was achieved through increased discarding of red throat emperor. Catches of both coral trout and red throat emperor that were derived from the model were higher than those recently observed in the fishery. The effort predicted by the model, however, closely approximated the actual effort observed in the fishery following implementation of ITQ management.},

We built a spatially explicit biological and economic model of the fishery to analyze the trade-offs between maintaining given levels of fish biomass and the net financial returns from fishing under different management regimes. Results of the scenarios we modeled suggested that a decrease in total allowable catch at high levels of harvest either increased net returns or lowered them only slightly, but increased biomass by up to 10\% for a wide range of reserve sizes and an increase in the reserve area from none to 16\% did not greatly change net returns at any catch level. Thus, catch shares and no-take reserves can be complementary and when these methods are used jointly they promote lower total allowable catches when harvest is relatively high and encourage larger no-take areas when they are small.},

HCRs, however, often require data-intensive stock assessments to facilitate the harvest prescription. An HCR based on catch and catch per unit effort (cpue) was developed for the southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery of Australia, for stocks that lack the data needed to conduct a full statistical catch-at-age assessment. The HCR produces a recommended biological catch and is characterized by two parameters, target cpue and target catch, both derived from historical data. Simulation tests showed that the HCR could guide the stock to the desired state from different initial levels of depletion. However, the selection of parameter values for the HCR was critical. Achieving fishery objectives was difficult when the target catch was a function of recent catch, rather than data from a predefined historical reference period. Problems may also arise when specifying the reference period on which the HCR parameters are determined. The cpue-based HCR is a valuable tool for managing fisheries where monitoring and assessment activities are relatively expensive, or in general, where data are scarce.},

  abstract = {Fisheries management operates in an environment characterized by multiple risks. These risks are often complementary and can be traded off against each other. An important goal for managers is to develop strategies to minimize the overall risk exposure at minimal cost. We show a simple model that quantifies a range of risks faced by fisheries management agencies in terms of long-term expected budgetary expenditure. The model includes not only the cost a management agency would be expected to incur from overfishing a stock, or from being seen to overfish it, but also the social cost incurred from not achieving its objectives, such as the opportunity cost of foregoing catches and economic returns. These costs can be controlled by adjusting the biomass level targeted by management, or increasing expenditures for data collection to improve the precision of biomass estimates. The overall risk, expressed as the long-term total expected cost to a management agency, depends strongly on the fisheries management objectives, and the emphasis on conservation or economic motives. In general, management under a conservation-oriented objective would reduce risk either by increasing target biomass levels or by expenditure on monitoring and assessment, while a catch-focused objective would seek to lower management costs by reducing expenditure on data collection and assessment. Increased natural stock variability affects the risk of overfishing, and long-term expected costs as the ability to make a meaningful estimate of biomass declines. Management of catch-focused fisheries would reduce the biomass target as stock variability increases, because the benefit of catches are seen to outweigh the cost, or risk of being overfished. The model provides the basis for more extensive risk analyses, and serves as a simple lesson that the consequences of reducing the short-term costs associated with managing a fishery can come with a concomitant increase in overall risk.},

  abstract = {Spatial management measures are currently being used to manage bycatch and discards, given the spatial heterogeneity of fish distributions. However, permanent fishing closures are often poorly implemented, unresponsive to stock dynamics and do not achieve their management objectives. Recently, real-time spatial management tools for managing bycatch and discards implemented under either a comanagement or self-governance approach have been introduced in Europe and the US. Real-time catch and discard information is shared among fishers to incentivise and encourage vessels to leave areas of high bycatch. Here, the similarities and differences, in governance, implementation and management of ten real-time spatial management systems from across Europe and the US are reviewed. A framework is developed to characterize the attributes associated with voluntary, private and regulatory real-time spatial management tools. Challenges and management practices in the different case studies are reviewed providing insights for designing these spatial management tools. The results illustrate that real-time spatial management approaches can create incentives for fishers to develop, use and share information and technology to avoid undesired catch. Compared with Europe, the US has developed spatial management tools with more truly real-time mechanisms and with greater involvement of the fishing industry in designing and operating the tools.},

We used nonlinear time series analysis to determine (1) the presence of nonlinear dynamics in fish populations on Georges Bank, (2) the minimum number of dimensions required to effectively describe system dynamics, (3) the strength of patterns of co-predictability among all possible pairs of fish species, and (4) identification of groups of species characterized by similar dynamics. Here, nonlinear behavior refers to non-equilibrium dynamics, including chaos. The population trajectories of all 26 species exhibited strong density-dependent feedback as indicated by a Partial Rate Correlation Function analysis. Significant evidence of complex dynamical behavior was found for approximately 1 in 5 species. Low dimensionality for many of the individual series was identified, suggesting that for a given level of predictability, this system can be represented by a relatively small number of critically important ecological variables. Further, we found high levels of co-predictability among pairwise combinations of individual species. We identified 4 major species groups sharing similar dynamic features on the basis of patterns of co-predictability, and explored potential mechanisms for interpreting the groupings in terms of trophic interactions and life history characteristics.},

Waters surrounding the archipelago show a large range of temperature and salinity in association with four different current systems. West zones of Isabella and Fernandina Islands are the largest upwelling zones, resulting from the collision of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) with the islands, bringing relatively colder, salty waters to the surface and marking the location of the highest biological production. Model results, which agree well with observations, show a seasonal cycle in the transport of the EUC, reaching a maximum during the late spring/early summer and minimum in the late fall. The far northern region is characterized by warmer, fresher water with the greatest mixed layer depth as a result of Panama Current waters entering from the northeast. Water masses over the remainder of the region result from mixing of cool Peru Current waters and upwelled Cold Tongue waters entering from the east.},

This review identifies strengths and weaknesses of eight HCMs and evaluates their ability to meet a multitude of common biological, ecological, and socioeconomic management objectives such as protecting spawning biomass, reducing bycatch, and sustaining fishers' profit. Evidence suggests that individual HCMs often fail to meet management objectives and may unintentionally create incentives to race to fish, discard catch and overcapitalize fishing operations.

Thus density-dependent changes in life-history characteristics should occur when populations are allowed to recover in MPAs. In this review, we synthesize the existing information on resource limitation in marine ecosystems, density-dependent changes in life-history traits of exploited populations and evidence for biomass export from MPAs. Most evidence for compensatory changes in biological variables has been derived from observations on populations depleted by high fishing mortality or on strong year classes, but these changes are more evident in juveniles than in adults and in freshwater rather than in marine systems. It is unclear if adults of exploited marine populations are resource limited. This may suggest that exploited populations are controlled mainly by density-independent processes, which could be a consequence of the depleted state of most exploited populations. MPAs could be a useful tool for testing these hypotheses. If we assume that resources become limiting inside MPAs, it is plausible that, if suitable habitats exist, mobile species will search for resources outside of the MPAs, leading to export of biomass to areas which are fished. However, it is not possible to establish from the available data whether this export will be a response to resource limitation inside the MPAs, the result of random movements across MPA boundaries or both. We discuss the implications of this process for the use of MPAs as fisheries management tools.},

Mortality was modelled as a power function of weight, and the parameters b (exponent) and Mu (mortality at the unit weight of 1 g) estimated for fish in the six ecosystems, as well as within selected populations, species and families. At the ecosystem level, no significant differences in parameters were found between lakes, rivers and the ocean and a joint mortality-weight relationship for all natural ecosystems was estimated with parameters b=-0.288 (90\% CL[-0.315, -0.261]) and Mu=3.00 (90\% CL[2.70, 3.30]) year-1. Among the culture systems, mortality-weight relationships in ponds and cages were not significantly different and a joint relationship was estimated. The weight exponents of mortality in ponds/cages and tanks were very similar at about b=-0.43, and significantly more negative than in natural ecosystems. Mortalities at unit weight were significantly lower in tanks (0.91 year-1) than in ponds/cages (2.24 year-1), and both were significantly lower than in natural ecosystems. No systematic differences were found between the mortality-weight relationships determined for individual populations, species or families, and fish in the respective ecosystems. It is hypothesized that aquaculture mortality-weight relationships indicate the allometric scaling of non-predation mortality, which is therefore more strongly size dependent than predation mortality. If non predation mortality in natural ecosystems shows a similar scaling with body weight, then the allometric exponent of predation mortality must be less negative than that observed for total natural mortality. Implications of the established mortality-weight relationships for aquaculture and culture-based fisheries are discussed.},

  abstract = {While the physical dimensions of climate change are now routinely assessed through multimodel intercomparisons, projected impacts on the global ocean ecosystem generally rely on individual models with a specific set of assumptions. To address these single-model limitations, we present standardized ensemble projections from six global marine ecosystem models forced with two Earth system models and four emission scenarios with and without fishing. We derive average biomass trends and associated uncertainties across the marine food web. Without fishing, mean global animal biomass decreased by 5\% ({$\pm$}4\% SD) under low emissions and 17\% ({$\pm$}11\% SD) under high emissions by 2100, with an average 5\% decline for every 1 \textdegree{}C of warming. Projected biomass declines were primarily driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production, and were more pronounced at higher trophic levels, a process known as trophic amplification. Fishing did not substantially alter the effects of climate change. Considerable regional variation featured strong biomass increases at high latitudes and decreases at middle to low latitudes, with good model agreement on the direction of change but variable magnitude. Uncertainties due to variations in marine ecosystem and Earth system models were similar. Ensemble projections performed well compared with empirical data, emphasizing the benefits of multimodel inference to project future outcomes. Our results indicate that global ocean animal biomass consistently declines with climate change, and that these impacts are amplified at higher trophic levels. Next steps for model development include dynamic scenarios of fishing, cumulative human impacts, and the effects of management measures on future ocean biomass trends.},

  abstract = {Density-dependent cannibalism, either on early benthic instars or on late prerecruits, has been hypothesized to regulate recruitment in the snow crab Chionoecetes opilio (O. Fabricius). However, there is little direct empirical or experimental evidence to support these hypotheses. We examined the stomach contents of 1218 C. opilio of 12\textendash{}135 mm carapace width (CW) for evidence of cannibalism. Crabs were collected by beam trawl in 1993 and 1994 in the estuary and northwest gulf of the Saint Lawrence River (Canada). Complementary laboratory experiments served to constitute a library of digested crab body parts for reference in the identification of stomach contents, and to evaluate the possibility and size-specificity of cannibalism on C. opilio instar I (settlers: 3 mm CW). The natural diet of C. opilio changed with increasing body size, with smallest crabs feeding mainly on amphipods and ophiuroids, while the largest crabs fed mainly on annelids, crustacean decapods and fish. Overall, conspecifics other than exuviae occurred in the stomachs of 7.2\% of wild caught C. opilio and were probably derived through predation rather than scavenged. Non-exuvial conspecifics were found most frequently in the stomachs of adult males (sperm-producing, chelae differentiated), with occurrence declining significantly from 22\% to 6\% of adult males by 10 mm CW size class over the range of 50\textendash{}120 mm CW. Conspecific prey ranged in size from 3.9\textendash{}48.8 mm CW, but most were immature crabs belonging to molt instars V ({$\approx$} 15 mm CW), VI ({$\approx$} 20 mm CW) and VII ({$\approx$} 28 mm CW). In the laboratory, instar I crabs were cannibalized by males of 8\textendash{}50 mm CW, but not by males of 51\textendash{}130 mm CW. Based on laboratory and field results, there are relative lower and upper size thresholds for vulnerability of intermolt crabs to cannibalism, which vary with predator size. We conclude that intraspecific predation may reduce cohort strength mainly over the first 4 years following settlement.},

  in long-term SBC LTER study plots obtained using SCUBA. The different
  Landsat sensors were calibrated to each other using simulated Landsat
  data derived from hyperspectral imagery. Missing data due to the ETM+
  scan line corrector error were filled using a synchrony-based gap
  filling method.

      
  Data are organized into a single NetCDF file and contain the quarterly

Aichi Targets represent specific, time-bound drivers for governments to safeguard both marine and terrestrial biodiversity.For the marine environment, Aichi Target 11 represents a call to effectively conserve at least 10\% of coastal and marine areas by 2020. The core indicator to measure Aichi Target 11 is the extent of protected area coverage, and therefore it is essential that MPA data used to calculate this metric are robust.The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the authoritative source of data for measuring Aichi Target coverage progress. The WDPA assimilates global protected areas data as officially reported by the UN Member States themselves.Analysis of the WDPA (August 2014) calculated that MPAs now cover approximately 12,300,000km2 or 3.41\% of the world's ocean. Only 0.59\% of the global ocean area (2 163 661km2 within 1124 areas) is protected in no-take areas.Only gathering and using State-sanctioned information may affect the accuracy of the WDPA MPA data. However, it is essential to first and foremost recognize national sovereignty and the rights of the Member State data providers in order to maintain a comprehensive approach to data gathering while ensuring international support for the resulting coverage figures that are used to measure global environmental targets.Further improvements could be made to the MPA data, for example by refining current MPA attributes and working with Member States and conventions to reduce or remove point data in the system. Moreover, broadening the scope of the WDPA to allow the inclusion of clearly marked non-State-sanctioned sites would complement existing official data and facilitate dialogue between Member States and other data providers towards MPA data improvement.},

  abstract = {Healthy ocean ecosystems are needed to sustain people and livelihoods and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Using the ocean sustainably requires overcoming many formidable challenges: overfishing, climate change, ocean acidification, and pollution. Despite gloomy forecasts, there is reason for hope. New tools, practices, and partnerships are beginning to transform local fisheries, biodiversity conservation, and marine spatial planning. The challenge is to bring them to a global scale. We dissect recent successes using a complex adaptive-systems (CAS) framework, which acknowledges the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems. Understanding how policies and practices change the feedbacks in CASs by altering the behavior of different system components is critical for building robust, sustainable states with favorable emergent properties. Our review reveals that altering incentives\textemdash{}either economic or social norms, or both\textemdash{}can achieve positive outcomes. For example, introduction of well-designed rights-based or secure-access fisheries and ecosystem service accounting shifts economic incentives to align conservation and economic benefits. Modifying social norms can create conditions that incentivize a company, country, or individual to fish sustainably, curb illegal fishing, or create large marine reserves as steps to enhance reputation or self-image. In each example, the feedbacks between individual actors and emergent system properties were altered, triggering a transition from a vicious to a virtuous cycle. We suggest that evaluating conservation tools by their ability to align incentives of actors with broader goals of sustainability is an underused approach that can provide a pathway toward scaling sustainability successes. In short, getting incentives right matters.},

  abstract = {Narratives help frame our thinking and action. On the eve of World Oceans Day and in anticipation of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021\textendash{}2030), a new narrative for the ocean is warranted\textemdash{}one that reflects current scientific knowledge and inspires new science and effective action.

For most of human history, people considered the ocean so immense, bountiful, and resilient that it was impossible to deplete or disrupt it. The overarching narrative was, ``The ocean is so vast, it is simply too big to fail.'' This mindset persists today, bringing even more intense, unsustainable uses of the ocean that reflect ignorance; the allure of new economic opportunity; or the need for food, resources, and development. However, the folly of this too-big-to-fail narrative has become glaringly obvious through overpowering scientific evidence of depletion, disruption, and pollution. Climate change, ocean acidification, habitat destruction, overfishing, and nutrient, plastic, and toxic pollution are insidious. These changes threaten the most vulnerable people; the economic prosperity, quality of life, and opportunities for everyone; and the well-being of the ocean's amazing life forms. Problems appear too complex, vested interests too powerful, and system inertia too great, especially as demands on the ocean escalate. A new narrative has arisen: ``The ocean is massively and fatally depleted and disrupted. The ocean is simply too big to fix.'' The result? Depression and lack of engagement and motivation.

Yet despite the undeniable challenges, hints of a new ocean mindset are emerging. Many powerful solutions already exist and could be scaled up. Opportunities abound to develop new solutions that are based on efficiency, incentives, technology, biotechnology, and regenerative and holistic approaches. Moreover, because the ocean is central to the functioning of the planet and human well-being, many ocean solutions could bring substantial co-benefits to address poverty, hunger, economic development, inequity, peace, security, coastal resilience, and climate mitigation and adaptation. For example, reforming fisheries to ``[fish smarter, not harder][1]'' can help restore ocean ecosystems; reduce impacts of climate change; and enhance food security, job creation, and poverty alleviation. Combining remote sensing, artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, transparency, and new policies can minimize [illegal fishing][2]. Enabling sustainable aquaculture\textemdash{}especially of low trophic species\textemdash{}could contribute substantially to food security, with a much smaller environmental footprint than that of terrestrial animal production. Creating fully and highly protected, well-designed [marine protected areas][3] will safeguard biodiversity, replenish the ocean, and help mitigate and adapt to climate change and ocean acidification. Incorporating ocean actions into the [climate agenda][4] is essential to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate disruption. Expanding the range of effective solutions and scaling them globally requires scientists to engage actively with communities, fishers, businesses, nongovernmental organizations, managers, and policy-makers so that solutions are complementary, integrated, effective, and rapid.

A new narrative does not automatically change the status quo but, if widely adopted, can reset expectations and liberate ingenuity. Yes, the challenges are fierce, and the future is unpredictable. But here is an opportunity to replicate, accelerate, and escalate existing successes while driving innovative and transformative changes. Key players in [the policy][5] and [business communities][6] are open to innovation. Now is the moment for more scientists to pivot from simply documenting the tragedy underway to also [creating scalable solutions][7].

It is time for a new ocean narrative that says, ``The ocean is so central to our future. It's too important to neglect.'' In creating a new solution space for the ocean, we can also address broader global problems. In healing the ocean, we can heal ourselves. The ocean sustains and feeds us. It connects us. It is our past and our future. The ocean is not too big to fail, nor is it too big to fix. It is too big to ignore.

Implications are tested against historical and anthropological data on bison populations, robe and hide prices, cattle-stocking rates, American military behavior, Indian tribal territories, federal land policy, the costs of harvesting bison, and formal and informal property rights regimes. The study uncovers the details of this famous story in American wildlife conservation and sheds light on the role of markets in extinction and preservation and the evolution of property rights to such large-scale natural resources.},

Depletion-corrected average catch: a simple formula for estimating sustainable yields in data-poor situations. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 2267\textendash{}2271.The depletion-corrected average catch (DCAC) formula is an extension of the potential-yield formula, and it provides useful estimates of sustainable yield for data-poor fisheries on long-lived species. Over an extended period (e.g. a decade or more), the catch is divided into a sustainable yield component and an unsustainable ``windfall'' component associated with a one-time reduction in stock biomass. The size of the windfall is expressed as being equivalent to a number of years of sustainable production, in the form of a ``windfall ratio''. The DCAC is calculated as the sum of catches divided by the sum of the number of years in the catch series and this windfall ratio. Input information includes the sum of catches and associated number of years, the relative reduction in biomass during that period, the natural mortality rate (M, which should be {$<$}0.2 year-1), and the assumed ratio of FMSY to M. These input values are expected to be approximate, and based on the estimates of their imprecision, the uncertainty can be integrated by Monte Carlo exploration of DCAC values.},

  abstract = {In 1977, Peter Larkin published his now-famous paper, `An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield'. Larkin criticized the concept of single-species maximum sustained yield (MSY) for many reasons, including the possibility that it may not guard against recruitment failure, and the impossibility of maximising sustainable yields for all species simultaneously. However, in recent years, there has been a fundamental change in the perception of the fishing mortality associated with MSY (FMSY) as a limit to be avoided rather than a target that can routinely be exceeded. The concept of FMSY as a limit is embodied in several United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) agreements and guidelines, and has now been incorporated into the US Magnuson\textendash{}Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. As a result, the United States now requires the development of overfishing definitions based on biological reference points that treat the FMSY as a limit reference point and must also define a lower limit on biomass below which rebuilding plans with strict time horizons must be developed. This represents a major paradigm shift from the previously mandated (but often unachieved) objective to simply maintain fishing mortalities at levels below those associated with recruitment overfishing. In many cases, it requires substantial reductions in current fishing mortality levels. Therefore, the necessity of the new paradigm is continually questioned. This paper draws on examples from several fisheries, but specifically focuses on the recent US experience illustrating the practical difficulties of reducing fishing mortality to levels below those corresponding to MSY. However, several studies suggest that even more substantial reductions in fishing mortality may be necessary if ecosystem considerations, such as multispecies interactions, maintenance of biodiversity and genetic diversity, and reduction of bycatch and waste, are taken into account. The pros and cons of moving beyond single-species assessment and management are discussed. A US plan for improving stock assessments indicates that even a `basic' objective such as `adequate baseline monitoring of all managed species' may be extremely costly. Thus, the suggestion of Larkin (1983, 1997) that the costs of research and management should not exceed 10\textendash{}20\% of the landed value of the catch may preclude comprehensive ecosystem management. More importantly, neither single-species nor ecosystem-based fisheries management is likely to improve appreciably unless levels of fishing capacity are aligned with resource productivity, as is currently being promoted by FAO and several individual nations.},

  abstract = {Residuals associated with catch-curve regressions can represent variable recruitment in fish populations. Catch curves are used to estimate steady-state mortality and assume relatively constant recruitment, but this assumption is rarely met. I documented the presence of abundant year classes of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), from earlier sampling and these dominant year classes persisted over time in two reservoirs. I expanded simple linear catch-curve regressions that used age (in years) as an independent regressor to multiple regression models each of which incorporated an additional independent environmental variable (ENVIR) that was measured when fish were age 0. The age term in the regression was proportionally weighted to the sample size at each age which deflated the influence of older and rarer fish in the analysis. This generalized regression equation: loge (NUMBER) = b0 - b1 (AGE) {$\pm$} b2 (ENVIR); explained variable abundance-at-age (NUMBER) and the environmental term was related to the formation of weak and strong year classes after accounting for the effects of age. Typically, age will explain the majority (r2 {$\geq$} 0.5) of the variation in abundance-at-age. For two largemouth bass populations, environmental hydraulic variables were significant (P {$<$} 0.10) terms in this equation and explained an additional 12 and 16\% of the variation in number after accounting for the variation explained by age. For data collected in one population 2 yrs after the initial analysis, the same strong and weak year classes persisted, residuals from these catch curves were correlated (r = 0.86, P {$<$} 0.05, N = 6), and the influence of hydrology on year class formation was duplicated. This approach can provide savings in labor and funds as abundance of young fish or recruitment indices do not have to be measured each year.},

Residuals from four catch-curve regressions for age-2\textendash{}11 fish collected in 1993 or 1994 were used to describe year-class strength. The formation of strong and weak year-classes was generally synchronous in these four reservoirs. Year-class strength was inversely related to average June\textendash{}July discharge and positively associated with retention (reservoir volume/discharge) for data pooled from all reservoirs. Thus, weak year-classes were produced during wet early-summer conditions after largemouth bass hatched, whereas stronger year-classes were produced during dryer early-summer conditions. Late-summer aquatic plant abundance and water level fluctuations during April\textendash{}May while spawning was occurring were not related to largemouth bass recruitment in these four reservoirs. We speculated that higher discharges and faster flushing rates were associated with reduced production at lower trophic levels and poorer survival of young largemouth bass that ultimately affected recruitment to adult size.},

  abstract = {Loligo opalescens live less than a year and die after a short spawning period before all oocytes are expended. Potential fecundity (EP), the standing stock of all oocytes just before the onset of spawning, increased with dorsal mantle length (L), where EP = 29.8L. For the average female squid (L of 129 mm), EP was 3844 oocytes. During the spawning period, no oogonia were produced; therefore the standing stock of oocytes declined as they were ovulated. This decline in oocytes was correlated with a decline in mantle condition and an increase in the size of the smallest oocyte in the ovary. Close agreement between the decline in estimated body weight and standing stock of oocytes during the spawning period indicated that maturation and spawning of eggs could largely, if not entirely, be supported by the conversion of energy reserves in tissue. Loligo opalescens, newly recruited to the spawning population, ovulated about 36\% of their potential fecundity during their first spawning day and fewer ova were released in subsequent days. Loligo opalescens do not spawn all of their oocytes; a small percentage of the spawning population may live long enough to spawn 78\% of their potential fecundity.

Loligo opalescens are taken in a spawning grounds fishery off California, where nearly all of the catch are mature spawning adults. Thirty-three percent of the potential fecundity of L. opalescens was deposited before they were taken by the fishery (December 1998-99). This observation led to the development of a management strategy based on monitoring the escapement of eggs from the fishery. The strategy requires estimation of the fecundity realized by the average squid in the population which is a function of egg deposition and mortality rates. A model indicated that the daily total mortality rate on the spawning ground may be about 0.45 and that the average adult may live only 1.67 days after spawning begins. The rate at which eggs escape the fishery was modeled and the sensitivity of changing daily rates of fishing mortality, natural mortality, and egg deposition was examined. A rapid method for monitoring the fecundity of the L. opalescens catch was developed.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are increasingly advocated for the conservation and management of sharks and rays. However, substantial uncertainty remains regarding which species can benefit from MPAs. Meanwhile, area-focused protection targets have spurred recent and rapid gains in the creation of large MPAs, many of which carry vague objectives set by a diverse group of stakeholders with potentially different notions of ``success.'' Here, we capture and critically evaluate current views on the use of MPAs for shark and ray conservation. Through interviews with scientists, MPA managers, fisheries experts, conservation practitioners, advocates and policy experts (n = 53), we demonstrate a variety of perspectives regarding: (a) the effectiveness of MPAs as a tool for shark and ray conservation; (b) which factors influence the success of MPAs for sharks and rays; and (c) the desired outcomes of these MPAs. While MPAs created specifically for sharks and rays were viewed to be slightly more effective than regular MPAs as a tool for shark and ray conservation, both were generally considered insufficient in isolation. Despite greater emphasis on social success factors (e.g., local support) over biophysical success factors (e.g., size), biological outcomes (e.g., increased abundance) were prioritized over social outcomes (e.g., livelihood benefits). We argue that a stronger focus on achieving social outcomes can enhance the potential for MPAs to benefit sharks and rays. In revealing current thinking regarding the drivers and indicators of MPA success for sharks and rays, the results of this study can inform efforts to conserve and manage these species.},

We evaluate which uncertainty method can be expected to perform best for fisheries stock assessment. The method should generate confidence intervals that are neither too narrow nor too wide, in order to cover the true value of estimated quantities with a probability matching the claimed confidence level. This simulation study compares the performance of the delta method, the bootstrap, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A statistical catch-at-age model is fitted to 1000 simulated datasets, with varying recruitment and observation noise. Six reference points are estimated, and confidence intervals are constructed across a range of significance levels. Overall, the delta method and MCMC performed considerably better than the bootstrap, and MCMC was the most reliable method in terms of worst-case performance, for our relatively data-rich scenario and catch-at-age model, which was not subject to substantial model misspecification. All three methods generated too narrow confidence intervals, underestimating the true uncertainty. Bias correction improved the bootstrap performance, but not enough to match the performance of the delta method and MCMC. We recommend using MCMC as the default method for quantifying uncertainty in fisheries stock assessment, although the delta method is the fastest to apply, and the bootstrap is useful to diagnose estimator bias.},

Existing knowledge about each fishery is stored in a database included in the software, and may be easily modified. This includes the parameters describing each population and each fishing activity. Furthermore, the software allows for flexibility in several model assumptions. Both management measures and behaviour of fishermen in reaction to these measures may be interactively designed through a Script language. The simulation tool thus enables one to compare the respective impacts of conventional management measures like catch and effort controls, and measures more recently advocated like marine protected areas.},

In the terrestrial realm, resource depletion has classically been related to accessibility through road networks. In contrast, in the marine realm, the impact on living resources is often framed into the Malthusian theory of human density around ecosystems. Here, we develop a new framework to estimate the accessibility of global coral reefs using potential travel time from the nearest human settlement or market. We show that 58\% of coral reefs are located {$<~$}30~min from the nearest human settlement. We use a case study from New Caledonia to demonstrate that travel time from the market is a strong predictor of fish biomass on coral reefs. We also highlight a relative deficit of protection on coral reef areas near people, with disproportional protection on reefs far from people. This suggests that conservation efforts are targeting low-conflict reefs or places that may already be receiving de facto protection due to their isolation. Our global assessment of accessibility in the marine realm is a critical step to better understand the interplay between humans and resources.},

Moreover, we observed that their computational requirements are considerably greater than those of statistical methods. The paper discusses the results, explains why the accuracy of ML models is below that of statistical ones and proposes some possible ways forward. The empirical results found in our research stress the need for objective and unbiased ways to test the performance of forecasting methods that can be achieved through sizable and open competitions allowing meaningful comparisons and definite conclusions.},

By a combination of Ocean Acoustic Waveguide Remote Sensing (OAWRS) and conventional sensing methods, first-look images of the instantaneous population density are obtained of entire Atlantic cod spawning groups, stretching for tens of kilometres in the Nordic Seas. This structural information made it possible to quantify the spawning group size distribution of cod over a roughly 30-year period from conventional line-transect data acquired annually by vertical echo sounding in the Nordic Seas. The size distribution is found to be consistent with the log-normal probability density often found in growth processes that depend on many independent parameters. Nordic Seas cod populations are found to distribute into many vast behavioural groups during spawning with relatively stable mean size despite larger variations in total annual population. When sustained at pre-industrial levels, the total spawning population is found to greatly exceed the mean spawning group size. As an apparent consequence of this large differential, when the total population, or overall scale, declined to within a standard deviation of this mean cod spawning group quantum, or inner-group-behavioural scale, return to pre-industrial levels required decades. Findings for Atlantic herring are similar, where summing the spawning group populations measured in a single instantaneous OAWRS image per day over the 8-day peak spawning period enabled accurate enumeration of the entire Georges Bank herring spawning population to within 7\% of the independent NOAA estimate for 2006. These results may be relevant to other oceanic fish.},

From the vantage points of political economy and geopolitics, this article investigates the potential ramifications of this shift in funding for large-scale marine protected areas (LMPAs), which have been widely promoted to enhance marine biodiversity and manage sustainable fisheries. Specific attention is given to the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) in Kiribati, where finance from US-based philanthropic foundations is intended to support the operation and management of the LMPA and eventually compensate the government for forgone revenues from fishing licences, via the creation of a trust fund. Content analysis of key documents is conducted to empirically trace the political, legal, and financial evolution of PIPA. The findings demonstrate how, in accepting finance from philanthropic foundations, the government of Kiribati gradually relinquishes its decision-making leverage over PIPA's territory and resources. Hence, it is contended that certain legal and financial provisions could act as under-acknowledged and purposive drivers of `ocean-control grabbing'. Results further reveal that achieving financial sustainability for the PIPA conservation trust fund has proven difficult, opening up discussions on the extent to which PIPA could be capitalised in other ways. More broadly, the paper engages with recent debates on for-profit conservation, ocean grabbing, and the blue economy.},

Holt and Ray Beverton then gave a life-history interpretation to the analysis, from which Beverton developed a theory of Growth, Maturity, and Longevity (GML) that allows one to predict quantities such as age at maturity or relative size at maturity using life-history parameters. I extend their results in two ways. First, keeping the original formulation, in which the rate of natural mortality is constant, I show how one can invert Beverton's result to determine the rate of natural mortality from life-history data. I illustrate this inverse method with data on three species of tuna and compare the estimates with those based on tagging. Second, I extend Beverton's GML theory to include size-dependent mortality. I explore previously published mortality models and introduce a new mortality function that has size-independent and size-dependent components. I show that the new size-dependent mortality function leads to the prediction that age at maturity depends upon asymptotic size (as well as the other life-history parameters), something that Beverton's original theory lacked. I illustrate this extension with a simple example, discuss directions for future work and conclude that nearly 60~years on these contributions of Holt and Beverton continue to lead us in new and exciting directions.},

Our methods involve a preliminary period of searching and fishing, followed by a Bayesian update of information and a reallocation of vessels. The first search problem that we study is how to determine the optimal allocation of search effort over several historical fishing grounds, in which the current abundance of fish has a known prior probability distribution. In our second application, we consider the case of a single fishing ground and determine the optimal allocation of search effort over time. We assume that fishermen are profit maximizers (although this can be relaxed) and compare the value of competitive fishing strategies with cooperative ones in which search effort is optimized.},

The present paper therefore reports an investigation of Ricker's definition of MSY, focusing on words such as "average catch," "continuously taken," and "existing environmental conditions." The investigation involved development of a model for the squid fishery in California, probably the last great open-access fishery on the west coast of the United States. Constructing the model in a step-wise fashion permitted illustration of particular points. Insight from the model leads to a deeper understanding of the definition of MSY, particularly that different methods of averaging and explicitly including risk to the stock in MSY may allow MSY to be used in the context of precautionary fishery management. Finally, results from the Third Mote Symposium that also shed light on this issue are summarized.},

At its inception, fishery science was limited by a nineteenth century mechanistic worldview and by computational technology; thus, the relatively simple equations of population ecology became the fundamental ecological science underlying fisheries. The time has come for this to change and for community ecology to become the fundamental ecological science underlying fisheries. This point will be illustrated with two examples. First, when viewed from a community perspective, excess production must be considered in the context of biomass left for predators. We argue that this is a better measure of the effects of fisheries than spawning biomass per recruit. Second, we shall analyse a simple, but still multi\textendash{}species, model for fishery management that considers the alternatives of harvest regulations, inshore marine protected areas and offshore marine protected areas. Population or community perspectives lead to very different predictions about the efficacy of reserves.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the biomass of reproductively mature individuals (spawning stock) and the resulting offspring added to the population (recruitment), the stock\textendash{}recruitment relationship, is a fundamental and challenging problem in all of population biology. The steepness of this relationship is commonly defined as the fraction of recruitment from an unfished population obtained when the spawning stock biomass is 20\% of its unfished level. Since its introduction about 20~years ago, steepness has become widely used in fishery management, where it is usually treated as a statistical quantity. Here, we investigate the reproductive ecology of steepness, using both unstructured and age-structured models. We show that if one has sufficient information to construct a density-independent population model (maximum per capita productivity and natural mortality for the unstructured case or maximum per capita productivity, natural mortality and schedules of size and maturity at age for the structured model) then one can construct a point estimate for steepness. Thus, steepness cannot be chosen arbitrarily. If one assumes that the survival of recruited individuals fluctuates within populations, it is possible, by considering the early life history, to construct a prior distribution for steepness from this same demographic information. We develop the ideas for both compensatory (Beverton\textendash{}Holt) and over-compensatory (Ricker) stock\textendash{}recruitment relationships. We illustrate our ideas with an example concerning bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus/orientalis, Scombridae). We show that assuming that steepness is unity when recruitment is considered to be environmentally driven is not biologically consistent, is inconsistent with a precautionary approach, and leads to the wrong scientific inference (which also applies for assigning steepness any other single value).},

This study aims to determine if the projected economic benefits of management reform outweigh the increases in management costs required to achieve those benefits. To answer this question, we developed a database of country-level fisheries management costs and use those to estimate the country-level costs of management changes. We use this framework to compare estimates of future costs of management upgrades against their economic benefits in terms of profit. Results indicate that for most nations, including the top 25 fishing nations, management upgrades outweigh their associated costs. This result is robust to a number of alternative assumptions about costs. Results also suggest that stronger reforms such as rights-based management, although sometimes more expensive to implement, can lead to greater net economic benefits compared to alternatives.},

A monopoly renewable resource manager, such as a harvester cooperative, may create a gain relative to a rent-dissipating sector because of its internalization of the impact of harvesting on the resource stock. As the monopolist reduces harvest, resource stocks recover and resource rent is generated through reduced harvesting costs. Thus, it is possible that the monopoly harvest exceeds the rent-dissipated harvest over time, leaving both producers and consumers better off. We argue that local resource management institutions that exert market power should not be considered violations of antitrust laws without first considering the costs and benefits of monopoly management. In cases where outside management has not had success, local management with monopoly power could represent a second-best solution. JEL Codes: Q2, L4.},

Loggerheads (Caretta caretta) were remotely tracked in the Atlantic Ocean using small solar-powered satellite transmitters. We show that oceanic-stage turtles (i) rarely travel in Continental Shelf waters, (ii) frequently depart the currents associated with the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, (iii) travel quickly when in Gyre currents, and (iv) select sea surface habitats that are likely to provide a thermal benefit or refuge to young sea turtles, supporting growth, foraging and survival. Our satellite tracks help define Atlantic loggerhead nursery grounds and early loggerhead habitat use, allowing us to re-examine sea turtle `lost years' paradigms.},

A growing body of evidence highlights a strong tendency for PDO impacts in the Southern Hemisphere, with important surface climate anomalies over the mid-latitude South Pacific Ocean, Australia and South America. Several independent studies find evidence for just two full PDO cycles in the past century: ``cool'' PDO regimes prevailed from 1890\textendash{}1924 and again from 1947\textendash{}1976, while ``warm'' PDO regimes dominated from 1925\textendash{}1946 and from 1977 through (at least) the mid-1990's. Interdecadal changes in Pacific climate have widespread impacts on natural systems, including water resources in the Americas and many marine fisheries in the North Pacific. Tree-ring and Pacific coral based climate reconstructions suggest that PDO variations\textemdash{}at a range of varying time scales\textemdash{}can be traced back to at least 1600, although there are important differences between different proxy reconstructions. While 20th Century PDO fluctuations were most energetic in two general periodicities\textemdash{}one from 15-to-25 years, and the other from 50-to-70 years\textemdash{}the mechanisms causing PDO variability remain unclear. To date, there is little in the way of observational evidence to support a mid-latitude coupled air-sea interaction for PDO, though there are several well-understood mechanisms that promote multi-year persistence in North Pacific upper ocean temperature anomalies.},

Assessments of the relative strengths and weaknesses for the different analytical approaches are also offered. Some of these methods are applied to a collection of fishery oceanographic time series for the N. Pacific to illustrate aspects of their relative utility and limitations for diagnosing regime shift behavior. One recommendation for future studies is to analyze biotic and abiotic time series separately in order to identify ecosystem state variables of interest and to better isolate ecosystem behaviors from other influences like environmental change. Methods that allow for quantitative assessments of the statistical significance of hypothesized regime shifts should be favored over those that do not. Analyses of especially large collections of time series may benefit from first using a data compression technique and then applying one of the methods that are more appropriate for just one or a small number of time series. Because of the difficulties in observing and adequately documenting many aspects of marine ecosystem variability, it is crucial that future research attempt to combine empirical studies of large marine ecosystems with theoretical and modeling studies of other systems for which the dynamics and predictability are better understood. With such a comparative approach it should be possible to refine conceptual and simulation models, while also identifying crucial gaps in existing observations.},

Formal management strategy evaluation (MSE) facilitates quantitative assessment of strengths and weaknesses of alternative management strategies designed to meet multiple agenda. The reef line fishery on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia) operates under multiple jurisdictions in a World Heritage Area with diverse stakeholder agenda for conservation and commercial and recreational harvest. We worked with stakeholders to identify: (i) specific objectives; (ii) alternative management strategies; and (iii) performance indicators to compare likelihoods of meeting economic, recreational and stock objectives for the fishery and conservation objectives for the effects of line fishing on the GBR. Stakeholders identified objectives and associated performance indicators in four categories, for: (1) conservation of unfished populations; (2) the harvestable stock; (3) economic performance of the fishery; (4) satisfaction of recreational fishers. We used a metapopulation and fishing simulation model (ELFSim) to assess the effects of three effort regimes in combination with three area closure regimes on the primary target species, common coral trout (Plectropomus leopardus). The nine management strategies were also compared with a zero fishing scenario for reference. Controlling fishing effort most improved prospects of meeting economic, stock and recreational satisfaction objectives for the fishery. Nine of ten performance indicators across all stakeholder objectives were maximised when fishing effort was at the lowest non-zero level tested. Maximising the area closed to fishing with reduced fishing effort was most likely to achieve the conservation objectives. This research provides a case study of productive engagement with stakeholders to address fisheries and conservation management needs in a multi-sectoral spatial management context. Together, we provided a common currency (the prospect of meeting quantified objectives) for impartial evaluation of performance of alternative management options against diverse and often competing stakeholder agenda.},

Reserves alone are not adequate for nature conservation but they are the cornerstone on which regional strategies are built. Reserves have two main roles. They should sample or represent the biodiversity of each region and they should separate this biodiversity from processes that threaten its persistence. Existing reserve systems throughout the world contain a biased sample of biodiversity, usually that of remote places and other areas that are unsuitable for commercial activities. A more systematic approach to locating and designing reserves has been evolving and this approach will need to be implemented if a large proportion of today's biodiversity is to exist in a future of increasing numbers of people and their demands on natural resources.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the hypothesis that small tunas and the various species found in association with drifting fads (such as mahi-mahi , rainbow runner, wahoo, etc.) may be biologically trapped by such a strong association. Massive seeding of drifting artificial fads was observed worldwide during recent years. In this hypothesis, we suggest that fads may alter some biological characteristics of epipelagic populations associated with them: migration, growth, condition factors, predation and natural mortality. As fads are most often used in the equatorial currents, they tend to exhibit zonal drift. Therefore, the associated populations would be artificially transferred from one part of the ocean to another, when they would show different movement patterns in the absence of fads. Natural logs were probably beneficial in terms of ecology and evolution, because they tend to accumulate in convergence areas, most often considered as rich forage areas. Now, fads are seeded in offshore areas, which are not necessarily favourable for tuna feeding. This apparently strong association between fishes and drifting fads may then produce an unexpected biological impact on tuna populations and their associated fauna. The plan is to test this hypothesis in the Atlantic, developing an ad hoc research programme based on tagging, biological and physiological studies, in association to an analysis of high resolution fishery data before and after the development of the fad fishery.Original Abstract: Cet article discute l'hypothese selon laquelle les petits thons et les differentes especes associees a des DCP derivants (comme les coryphenes, elagatis, thazards, etc.) pourraient etre pris dans un piege biologique resultant de cette forte association.

MPAs are expected to replenish nearby exploited populations through the natural dispersal of young, but the models that make these predictions rely on assumptions that have recently been demonstrated to be incorrect for most species of fish. A meta-analysis showed that fish reproductive output scales ``hyperallometrically'' with fish mass, such that larger fish produce more offspring per unit body mass than smaller fish. Because fish are often larger inside MPAs, they should exhibit disproportionately higher reproductive output as compared to fish outside of MPAs. We explore the consequences of hyperallometric reproduction for a range of species for population replenishment and the productivity of exploited species. We show that the reproductive contribution of fish inside MPAs has been systematically underestimated and that fisheries yields can be enhanced by the establishment of reservoirs of larger, highly fecund fish.},

We define and classify the different kinds of zeros that occur in ecological data and describe how they arise: either from `true zero' or `false zero' observations. After reviewing recent developments in modelling zero-inflated data sets, we use practical examples to demonstrate how failing to account for the source of zero inflation can reduce our ability to detect relationships in ecological data and at worst lead to incorrect inference. The adoption of methods that explicitly model the sources of zero observations will sharpen insights and improve the robustness of ecological analyses.},

The inverse of this approach\textemdash{}inferring which processes and ecological interactions drive observed dynamics\textemdash{}remains an open problem in ecology. Here, we propose a way to attack this problem using a machine learning method known as symbolic regression, which seeks to discover relationships in time-series data and to express those relationships using dynamical equations. We found that this method could rapidly discover models that explained most of the variance in three classic demographic time series. More importantly, it reverse-engineered the models previously proposed by theoretical ecologists to describe these time series, capturing the core ecological processes these models describe and their functional forms. Our findings suggest a potentially powerful new way to merge theory development and data analysis.},

We explored geographic variation in demographic rates of an exploited benthic species, the wavy-turban snail Megastraea undosa, along the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico. We compared key life-history traits (i.e. fecundity, size at maturity, growth, and survivorship) of populations existing between 20 and 170 km apart under different conditions of ocean temperature and food availability. Trade-offs between growth and reproduction were evident across this environmental gradient, with higher growth rates in warmer locations leading to lower size-specific investment in gonad production. Because later onset of reproduction in populations from warmer areas was compensated by greater fecundity at larger sizes, geographic variation in life-history strategies resulted in similar age-specific reproductive output among different populations. However, we observed that, while there is substantial variation in demographic rates of the study species, harvest management is applied uniformly, and this results in southern populations achieving lower reproductive output before they reach a legally harvestable size. Our results highlight the importance of considering geographic variation in multiple life-history traits when managing across a mosaic of land- and seascapes characterized by varying environmental conditions.},

To inform future research and policy decisions, we reviewed the scientific literature to assess MPA impacts on five indicators of human welfare: food security, resource rights, employment, community organization, and income. Following MPA establishment, food security generally remained stable or increased in older and smaller MPAs. The ability of most fishing groups to govern MPA resources changed. Increased resource rights were positively correlated with MPA zoning and compliance with MPA regulations. Small sample sizes precluded statistical tests of the impacts of MPAs on employment, community organization, and income. Our results demonstrate that MPAs shape the social well-being and political power of fishing communities; impacts (positive and negative) vary within and among social groups; and social impacts are correlated with some\textemdash{}but not all\textemdash{}commonly hypothesized explanatory factors. Accordingly, MPAs may represent a viable strategy for enhancing food security and empowering local communities, but current practices negatively affect at least a minority of fishers. To inform policy making, further research must better document and explain variation in the positive and negative social impacts of MPAs.},

This integrated three-framework approach for impact evaluation of governance in social\textendash{}ecological systems (3FIGS) accounts for alternative explanations, builds upon and advances social theory, and provides novel policy insights in ways that no single approach affords. Despite the inherent complexity of social\textendash{}ecological systems and the difficulty of causal inference, the 3FIGS approach can dramatically advance our understanding of, and the evidentiary basis for, effective MPAs and other conservation initiatives.},

Spatial distribution of fishing effort before and after implementation of the marine reserve is also compared. Some concentration of effort occurred along parts of the closed area boundaries.

We apply a specific GLMM for longitudinal data, a hierarchical Bayesian logistic mixed-effects model (BLMM), to a marine ecology dataset obtained from submersible video recordings of the seabed on transects at two sites in the Gulf of Alaska. The BLMM was effective in relating the presence of red tree corals (Primnoa pacifica; i.e. binary data) to habitat characteristics: the presence of red tree corals is highly associated with bedrock as the primary substrate (estimated odds ratio 9\textendash{}19), high to very high seabed roughness (estimated odds ratio 3\textendash{}5), and medium to high slope (estimated odds ratio 2\textendash{}3). The covariate depth was less important at the sites. We also demonstrate and compare two methods of model checking: full and mixed posterior predictive assessments, the latter of which provided a more realistic assessment, and we calculate the variance partition coefficient for reporting the variation explained by multiple levels of the hierarchical model.},

A wide range of statistical approaches are employed for the task, including multiple regression models, autoregressive methods, different classes of generalized linear models, mixed model approaches and many others. However, the applicability of these statistical approaches can be limited in specific cases of complex fisheries. We developed a new catch projection model for quota-based fisheries on the West Coast of the U.S. to forecast annual catch and landings for a variety of groundfish species in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The model projects total and landed catch of each species by individual vessel and for the entire fishing fleet, using a combination of weighted mean vessel attainment rates and historical catch rates, and generates uncertainty intervals. It demonstrated an ability to produce highly accurate predictions at both fleet (R2 = 0.9847) and vessel levels (R2 = 0.8447). The model framework contains much built-in versatility, is generalizable enough to serve a variety of quota based applications, and the approach can be tailored to other fisheries around the world. With the proliferation of quota based management of commercial fisheries, tools such as this one are increasingly useful for sustainable management of fishery resources.},

  abstract = {A general framework is presented for integrating the standardization of catch per unit of effort (CPUE) into stock assessment models. Catchability is modeled using both continuous and categorical explanatory variables. The likelihood for the CPUE data is combined with the other likelihoods from the stock assessment model; the parameters used to model catchability are estimated simultaneously with the other parameters of the stock assessment model. The method is applied to a New Zealand rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) stock, and the results are compared with those obtained using a generalized linear model. The point estimates are similar for both methods, but the confidence intervals from the integrated framework are much narrower. Simulation analysis supports the findings that the integrated approach gives narrower confidence intervals that more accurately represent the uncertainty in the parameter estimates, provided the model is correct., On trouvera ici un cadre g{\'e}n{\'e}ral pour int{\'e}grer la standardisation de la capture par unit{\'e} d'effort de p{\^e}che (CPUE) dans les mod{\`e}les d'{\'e}valuation des stocks.

I describe integrated analysis and Bayesian analysis, which have been two of the most influential paradigms in fisheries stock assessment during the last two decades of the twentieth century. These two paradigms have generally been considered complementary, rather than competing. However, recent advances in integrated analysis, including the special case of meta-analysis, have made Bayesian analysis somewhat redundant. I describe how data used to create priors for use in Bayesian analysis can be integrated directly into the analyses. This provides a much more convenient way of accurately including the information and associated uncertainty into the analyses. I discuss how there is still a need to describe the uncertainty and suggest that research should focus on the most appropriate methods for doing this.},

We apply this method to the stock of trevally (Pseudocaranx dentex) off the west coast of New Zealand to address: (1) whether the stock assessment model explains all of the annual variation in the CPUE data, and (2) the impact on the assessment results of how the catch-at-age data are weighted. If not all of annual variation in CPUE is explained by the stock assessment model, the assessment may be statistically inadequate. The inadequacy may be in the representation of the population dynamics, in the relationship between CPUE and abundance, or due to additional variation in CPUE left unexplained by the independent variables. Catch-at-age data often have too much influence on the estimated abundance trajectory, so the sample size used in the catch-at-age likelihood function is often reduced when applying age-structured stock assessment methods. The integrated approach automatically places more weight on the CPUE data compared to the catch-at-age data, and may therefore provide an alternative to arbitrarily downweighting catch-at-age data.},

However, forward projections and their associated estimates of uncertainty are an important and popular piece of management advice. We describe a less computationally intense method to estimate uncertainty in forward projections that includes both parameter uncertainty and future demographic stochastic uncertainty. This frequentist method uses penalized likelihood as an approximation to mixed effects and can be viewed as treating the future projection period as part of the estimation model rather than performing stochastic projections. This allows confidence intervals to be calculated using normal approximation based on the delta method. The method is tested using simulation analysis and compared with Bayesian analysis and with projections based on point estimates of the parameters. The method is applied to yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean.},

Raw cpue is seldom proportional to abundance over a whole exploitation history and an entire geographic range, because numerous factors affect catch rates. One of the most commonly applied fisheries analyses is standardization of cpue data to remove the effect of factors that bias cpue as an index of abundance. Even if cpue is standardized appropriately, the resulting index of relative abundance, in isolation, provides limited information for management advice or about the effect of fishing. In addition, cpue data generally cannot provide information needed to assess and manage communities or ecosystems. We discuss some of the problems associated with the use of cpue data and some methods to assess and provide management advice about fish populations that can help overcome these problems, including integrated stock assessment models, management strategy evaluation, and adaptive management. We also discuss the inappropriateness of using cpue data to evaluate the status of communities. We use tuna stocks in the Pacific Ocean as examples.},

Incorrect assumptions can have a substantial impact on stock assessment results and management advice. Unfortunately, there is a lack of understanding of these processes for most, if not all, stocks and even for processes that have traditionally been assumed to be well understood (e.g. growth and selectivity). We use information content of typical fisheries data that is informative about absolute abundance to illustrate some of the main issues in fisheries stock assessment. We concentrate on information about absolute abundance from indices of relative abundance combined with catch, and age and length-composition data and how the information depends on knowledge of population, fishing, and sampling processes. We also illustrate two recently developed diagnostic methods that can be used to evaluate the absolute abundance information content of the data.

  abstract = {Contemporary fisheries stock assessments often use multiple diverse data sets to extract as much information as possible about biological and fishery processes. However, models are, by definition, simplifications of reality and, therefore, misspecified. Model misspecification can cause degradation of results when multiple data sets are analyzed simultaneously. The process, observation, and sampling components of the model must all be, at least, approximately correct to minimize bias. Unfortunately, even the basic processes that are usually considered well understood (e.g., growth and selectivity) are misspecified in most, if not all, stock assessments. These misspecified processes, in combination with use of composition data, result in biased estimates of absolute abundance and abundance trends, which are often evident as ``data conflicts.'' This is compounded by over-weighting of composition data in many assessments owing to misuse of data-weighting approaches. The `law of conflicting data' states that since data are facts, conflicting data implies model misspecification, but must be interpreted in the context of random sampling error. Down-weighting (or dropping) conflicting data is not necessarily appropriate because it may not resolve the model misspecification. Model misspecification and process variation can be accounted for in the variance parameters of the likelihoods (sampling error), but it is unclear when, or even if, this is appropriate. The appropriate method to deal with data conflicts depends on whether it is caused by random sampling error, process variation, observation model misspecification, or misspecification of the system (dynamics) model. Diagnostic approaches are urgently needed to evaluate goodness of fit and to identify model misspecification. We recommend external estimation of the sampling error variance in likelihood functions, modelling process variation in integrated models, and internal estimation of the standard deviation of the process variation. The required statistical framework is computationally intensive, but practical approximations are available, computational algorithms are being improved, and computer power is increasing. We provide a framework for model development that identifies and corrects model misspecification and illustrate the framework, using simulated data.},

  abstract = {Recruitment is one of the most variable biological processes driving fisheries population dynamics and the characteristics and drivers of the variation differ among stocks. Understanding, describing (modeling), estimating, and predicting (forecasting) this variation is essential to appropriate stock assessment and fisheries management. Most modern stock assessments estimate annual variation in recruitment, particularly those that include age or size composition data. Changes over time are often partitioned into those related to the spawning biomass due to density dependence (the stock-recruitment relationship) and those related to other factors such as environmental conditions. Several methods have been used to model recruitment inside stock assessment models, and they differ by how recruitment is represented and how statistical inference is conducted. Virtual population analyses make few statistical assumptions about recruitment and instead calculate recruitment as the sum of the mortality-adjusted catches of a cohort while surplus production models generally imply a stock-recruitment relationship in their production function. Integrated statistical stock assessment models have modelled recruitment using a stock-recruitment relationship, autocorrelation, a function of covariates, regime shifts, or a combination of these. Statistical inference has typically been conducted using state-space (hierarchical) models, whether using Bayesian or maximum likelihood methods, or inferences are approximated using penalized likelihood approaches, which may not be statistically reliable. All these methods have specific issues that need to be addressed and there are tradeoffs in their use. Future temporal variation also needs to be considered when providing management advice. We review the theory and practice of modelling temporal variation in recruitment in fisheries stock assessment, provide advice on good practices, and recommend important research.},

Based on recent confirmation of determinate fecundity in this species, we describe how catch fecundity (i.e., eggs remaining in the reproductive tracts of harvested females) can be used to simultaneously infer fishing mortality rate along with management reference points such as yield-per-recruit, spawned eggs-per-recruit, and proportional egg escapement. Rates of mortality and egg laying have important effects on these reference points. Somewhat surprisingly, increasing the rate of natural mortality decreased spawned eggs-per-recruit while increasing proportional egg escapement. Increasing the rate of egg laying increased both spawned eggs-per-recruit and egg escapement. Other parameters, such as the maturation rate and gear vulnerability of immature females, affected the reference points. In actual practice, the influence of these parameters for immature squid may go undetected if immature squid are excluded from analysis of the catch. Application of this model to routine management is feasible but requires refinement of sampling procedures, biological assumptions, and model parameters. This model is useful because it is grounded on empirical data collected relatively inexpensively from catch samples (catch fecundity) while allowing for the simultaneous calculation of instantaneous fishing mortality rate and egg escapement.},

  abstract = {We document a tendency for published estimates of population size in sea turtles to be increasing rather than decreasing across the globe. To examine the population status of the seven species of sea turtle globally, we obtained 299 time series of annual nesting abundance with a total of 4417 annual estimates. The time series ranged in length from 6 to 47 years (mean, 16.2 years). When levels of abundance were summed within regional management units (RMUs) for each species, there were upward trends in 12 RMUs versus downward trends in 5 RMUs. This prevalence of more upward than downward trends was also evident in the individual time series, where we found 95 significant increases in abundance and 35 significant decreases. Adding to this encouraging news for sea turtle conservation, we show that even small sea turtle populations have the capacity to recover, that is, Allee effects appear unimportant. Positive trends in abundance are likely linked to the effective protection of eggs and nesting females, as well as reduced bycatch. However, conservation concerns remain, such as the decline in leatherback turtles in the Eastern and Western Pacific. Furthermore, we also show that, often, time series are too short to identify trends in abundance. Our findings highlight the importance of continued conservation and monitoring efforts that underpin this global conservation success story.
Many sea turtle populations are recovering, highlighting the value of conservation efforts and long-term monitoring.

We develop priors for the intrinsic rate of increase (r) in the Schaefer surplus production model using demographic methods and illustrate the utility of this with an application to large coastal sharks in the Atlantic. In 1996, a U.S. stock assessment obtained a point estimate for r of 0.26. For such long-lived and low-fecund organisms, this could potentially be too high.

To evaluate the status and trends in changing coastal resources over larger areas, managers in government agencies and private stakeholders around the world have increasingly turned to remote sensing technologies. A surge in collaborative and innovative efforts between resource managers, academic researchers, and industry partners is becoming increasingly vital to keep pace with evolving changes of our natural resources. Synoptic capabilities of remote sensing techniques allow assessments that are impossible to do with traditional methods. Sixty years of remote sensing research have paved the way for resource management applications, but uncertainties regarding the use of this technology have hampered its use in management fields. Here we review examples of remote sensing applications in the sectors of coral reefs, wetlands, water quality, public health, and fisheries and aquaculture that have successfully contributed to management and decision-making goals.},

  abstract = {Marine defaunation, or human-caused animal loss in the oceans, emerged forcefully only hundreds of years ago, whereas terrestrial defaunation has been occurring far longer. Though humans have caused few global marine extinctions, we have profoundly affected marine wildlife, altering the functioning and provisioning of services in every ocean. Current ocean trends, coupled with terrestrial defaunation lessons, suggest that marine defaunation rates will rapidly intensify as human use of the oceans industrializes. Though protected areas are a powerful tool to harness ocean productivity, especially when designed with future climate in mind, additional management strategies will be required. Overall, habitat degradation is likely to intensify as a major driver of marine wildlife loss. Proactive intervention can avert a marine defaunation disaster of the magnitude observed on land.
BACKGROUND Comparing patterns of terrestrial and marine defaunation helps to place human impacts on marine fauna in context and to navigate toward recovery. Defauna\-tion began in earnest tens of thousands of years later in the oceans than it did on land. Although defaunation has been less severe in the oceans than on land, our effects on marine animals are increasing in pace and impact. Humans have caused few complete extinctions in the sea, but we are responsible for many ecological, commercial, and local extinctions. Despite our late start, humans have already powerfully changed virtually all major marine ecosystems.
ADVANCES Humans have profoundly decreased the abundance of both large (e.g., whales) and small (e.g., anchovies) marine fauna. Such declines can generate waves of ecological change that travel both up and down ma\-rine food webs and can alter ocean ecosystem functioning. Human harvesters have also been a major force of evolutionary change in the oceans and have reshaped the genetic structure of marine animal populations. Climate change threatens to accelerate marine defaunation over the next century. The high mobility of many marine animals offers some increased, though limited, capacity for marine species to respond to climate stress, but it also exposes many species to increased risk from other stressors. Because humans are intensely reliant on ocean ecosystems for food and other ecosystem services, we are deeply affected by all of these forecasted changes. Three lessons emerge when comparing the marine and terrestrial defaunation experiences: (i) today's low rates of marine extinction may be the prelude to a major extinction pulse, similar to that observed on land during the industrial revolution, as the footprint of human ocean use widens; (ii) effectively slowing ocean defaunation requires both protected areas and careful management of the intervening ocean matrix; and (iii) the terrestrial experience and current trends in ocean use suggest that habitat destruction is likely to become an increasingly dominant threat to ocean wildlife over the next 150 years.
OUTLOOK Wildlife populations in the oceans have been badly damaged by human activity. Nevertheless, marine fauna generally are in better condition than terrestrial fauna: Fewer marine animal extinctions have occurred; many geographic ranges have shrunk less; and numerous ocean ecosystems remain more wild than terrestrial ecosystems. Consequently, meaningful rehabilitation of affected marine animal populations remains within the reach of managers. Human dependency on marine wildlife and the linked fate of marine and terrestrial fauna necessitate that we act quickly to slow the advance of marine defaunation. View larger version: In this page In a new window Download PowerPoint Slide for Teaching Timeline (log scale) of marine and terrestrial defaunation. The marine defaunation experience is much less advanced, even though humans have been harvesting ocean wildlife for thousands of years. The recent industrialization of this harvest, however, initiated an era of intense marine wildlife declines. If left unmanaged, we predict that marine habitat alteration, along with climate change (colored bar: IPCC warming), will exacerbate marine defaunation.
Marine animals are disappearing, too
The loss of animal species in terrestrial environments has been well documented and is continuing. Loss of species in marine environments has been slower than in terrestrial systems, but appears to be increasing rapidly. McCauley et al. review the recent patterns of species decline and loss in marine environments. Though they note many worrying declines, they also highlight approaches that might allow us to prevent the type of massive defaunation that has occurred on land.

  abstract = {The role of a marine protected area in enhancing local fisheries, through the emigration or spillover of exploitable fishes, was studied in a coral reef park (Mombasa Marine Park, Kenya) and fishery over a seven-year period during a time when the park's border changed and pull seines were eliminated. We measured catches before and after the park's establishment and during the management changes and compared these catches with the unmanaged side of the park. Additionally, we placed baited traps on both sides of the park over a full tidal cycle which allowed us to measure the spillover from the park compared to the deeper, rougher, and less fished reef edge. The total wet mass of catches per trap, the mean size of the trapped fish, and the number of fish species caught per trap declined as a function of the distance away from the park edge on both the southern and northern sides. However, this relationship was truncated on the unmanaged side which also had smaller catches, smaller fish, and fewer species than the managed side. Trap fishers on the managed side adapted to the spillover by increasing the traps per fisher, which had the effect of reducing the catch per trap. Tides and reef morphology also appeared to interact and influenced catches, but we found no relationships between catches and benthic substratum cover, which was usually dominated by seagrass and sand. Spillover from the deeper reef edge was evident for the managed but not the unmanaged side of the park, but may be due to differences in reef morphology interacting with tidal patterns rather than management. On the managed side, the park significantly increased the catch per fisher and catch per area by {$>$}50\%, but even after the park's size was reduced, the total catch was reduced by {$\sim$}30\%. The reduced park was still {$\sim$}50\% of the total area. Consequently, the catch per area increase was insufficient to compensate for the lost area over this early period of the park's establishment. Spillover was greatest for the dominant fisheries species. These were moderately vagile species in the rabbitfish (Siganidae; herbivores), emperors (Lethrinidae; carnivores), and surgeonfish (Acanthuridae; herbivores) families, which had instantaneous emigration rates from the park to the reserve fishing ground of {$\sim$}0.5. Our field survey, combined with previous modeling studies, based on adult emigration rates from marine reserves, suggests that tropical fisheries dominated by rabbitfish, emperors, and surgeonfish should be enhanced by closed areas of {$\sim$}10\textendash{}15\% of the total area. The optimal protected area may increase if larval export is important, but the predicted response should not be measurable for {$>$}10 years, beyond the length of our study, as breeding stock develop inside protected areas.},

  abstract = {The population density, species composition and lengths of fish landed by artisanal fishermen using six types of gear: large and small traps, gill nets, hand lines, spears and beach seines were studied in the multi-species fishery of southern Kenya. Selectivity and catch composition among gears were determined by studying the species richness, diversity, size and mean trophic level of the catches for each gear type, to develop gear-based management recommendations for this artisanal reef lagoon fishery. One hundred and sixty-three reef and reef-associated species from 37 families were recorded in the catch. Beach seines and small traps accounted for the highest number of fish landed (34\textendash{}35 individuals per fisherman per day). These gears also caught smaller fish than big traps, spears and gill nets. Beach seines caught the highest number of species (14~{$\pm{}~$}7 species per day) while most other gears caught four to five species per day with no differences between gears. Predatory species with a mean trophic level of 3.6 dominated catches from hand lines, while the mean trophic level of the other gears was low and ranged from 2.6 to 2.9 with no differences between the gears. The high diversity and small size of fish caught in beach seines indicates that its selectivity overlapped most with large traps and gill nets. Spears and small traps also showed high similarity in species selectivity and small traps captured the smaller mean size of fish, indicating that they are likely to pre-empt the resource of spears. Large traps, hand lines and spears catch the largest individuals and the species composition of the catch differed sufficiently such that their selectivity should overlap the least and may, therefore, be the preferred mix of gears. The elimination or reduction of beach seines and small traps should reduce the catch of small fish and overlap in selectivity among the existing gears.},

* 2.This paper provides a current assessment of the artisanal multi-species coral reef fishery by examining selectivity of the dominant gear, namely line fishing, spearguns, and gill nets. Each gear has its own strengths and weaknesses in terms of use and conservation of resources, with no clear problem gear.
* 3.The three gears utilize different resources but there was moderate overlap in the species caught, particularly between gill nets and line fishing and marginally between lines and spearguns. Gill nets have the disadvantage of being destructive to coral and the advantage of catching commercial species. Line fishing catches an intermediate number of species but mostly large-bodied and predatory species that could potentially reduce predation and the mean trophic level of the fishery. Spearguns catch the highest numbers of species, including many non-commercial and herbivorous fish and could reduce the diversity of fish and encourage algal growth.
* 4.This information could be used in combination with scientific monitoring and traditional ecological knowledge to develop an adaptive management framework that uses local restrictions on the various gears to restore or balance the fishery and ecosystem. Restrictions could be selectively imposed: on gill nets when coral cover is low, line fishing when large-bodied predators are depleted, and spearguns when biodiversity is reduced and algal abundance high.

These eight ecological metrics each exhibited specific thresholds along a continuum of fishable biomass ranging from heavily fished sites to old fisheries closures. Three thresholds lay above and five below a hypothesized window of fishable biomass expected to produce a maximum multispecies sustainable yield (BMMSY). Evaluating three management systems in nine countries, we found that unregulated fisheries often operate below the BMMSY, whereas fisheries closures and, less frequently, gear-restricted fisheries were within or above this window. These findings provide tangible management targets for multispecies coral reef fisheries and highlight key tradeoffs required to achieve different fisheries and conservation goals.},

  abstract = {Community-based management (CBM) could be an essential tool to prevent the depletion of marine resources in the Western Indian Ocean region. In Kenya, political pressure to strengthen local governance, has led to adoption of CBM as a way of reducing over-exploitation and managing the competing uses and impacts on the marine environment. Several communities in Kenya have embraced CBM and have set aside or closed previously fished areas to enhance recovery of fisheries and biodiversity. These community fisheries closures (locally called tengefu), despite being degraded, may recover to finfish abundances and biodiversity levels similar to established MPAs or above thresholds for maintaining some ecological services. Communities see their direct involvement and control of these tengefu as more likely to result in benefits flowing directly to them. Community closures are also important for articulating and resolving community values and strengthening their management capacity. Here, we describe the evolution of the tengefu movement in Kenya and combine information from focus group discussions, interviews, underwater surveys and boundary marking to evaluate the current status, opportunities and challenges facing these tengefu. We show that in some cases community closures suffer from slow and incomplete national and local legislative processes, challenges to compliance, and weak management.},

The ways in which this variability can be incorporated into assessments are controversial and there are few assessments that explicitly incorporate environmental factors in any way. Long-term databases have been increasingly mined in the last 20 years to develop indices or indicators that summarize environmental variability. Even when environmental time series are not used, the fishery-independent time series from ichthyoplankton surveys have proven invaluable to estimate spawning stock biomass trends for stock assessments. Univariate or multivariate indices are used in management frameworks either to assess performance of a fishery or to provide thresholds for management action. The Pacific sardine is one of the few assessments with an environmental control rule to provide a threshold for management action. I discuss the development of this indicator and its use in management. I use the sardine example to highlight some problems that can arise when environmental indices are reassessed. I also discuss the development of new and potentially more robust indicators.},

Historical photographs provide visual and quantitative evidence of changes in mean individual size and species composition for groups of marine fish that have been targeted by sport fishing. I measured such trends for 13 groups of recreationally caught ``trophy'' reef fish with photographs taken in Key West, Florida, from 1956 to 2007. The mean fish size declined from an estimated 19.9 kg (SE 1.5) to 2.3 kg (SE 0.3), and there was a major shift in species composition. Landings from 1956 to 1960 were dominated by large groupers (Epinephelus spp.), and other large predatory fish were commonly caught, including sharks with an average length of just {$<$}2 m. In contrast, landings in 2007 were composed of small snappers (Lutjanus spp. and Ocyurus chrysurus) with an average length of 34.4 cm (SE 0.62), and the average length of sharks declined by more than 50\% over 50 years. Major declines in the size of fish caught were not reflected in the price of fishing trips, so customers paid the same amount for a less-valuable product. Historical photographs provide a window into a more pristine coral reef ecosystem that existed a half a century ago and lend support to current observations that unfished reef communities are able to support large numbers of large-bodied fish.},

Management measures and voluntary industry actions can reduce these impacts, helping to meet sustainability objectives for fisheries, conservation and environmental management. These include changes in gear design and operation of trawls, spatial controls, impact quotas and effort controls. We review nine different measures and actions and use published studies and a simple conceptual model to evaluate and compare their performance. The risks and benefits of these management measures depend on the extent to which the fishery is already achieving management objectives for target stocks and the characteristics of the management system that is already in place. We offer guidance on identifying best practices for trawl-fisheries management and show that best practices and their likelihood of reducing trawling impacts depend on local, national and regional management objectives and priorities, societal values and resources for implementation. There is no universal best practice, and multiple management measures and industry actions are required to meet sustainability objectives and improve trade-offs between food production and environmental protection.},

  abstract = {The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) provides a globally significant demonstration of the effectiveness of large-scale networks of marine reserves in contributing to integrated, adaptive management. Comprehensive review of available evidence shows major, rapid benefits of no-take areas for targeted fish and sharks, in both reef and nonreef habitats, with potential benefits for fisheries as well as biodiversity conservation. Large, mobile species like sharks benefit less than smaller, site-attached fish. Critically, reserves also appear to benefit overall ecosystem health and resilience: outbreaks of coral-eating, crown-of-thorns starfish appear less frequent on no-take reefs, which consequently have higher abundance of coral, the very foundation of reef ecosystems. Effective marine reserves require regular review of compliance: fish abundances in no-entry zones suggest that even no-take zones may be significantly depleted due to poaching. Spatial analyses comparing zoning with seabed biodiversity or dugong distributions illustrate significant benefits from application of best-practice conservation principles in data-poor situations. Increases in the marine reserve network in 2004 affected fishers, but preliminary economic analysis suggests considerable net benefits, in terms of protecting environmental and tourism values. Relative to the revenue generated by reef tourism, current expenditure on protection is minor. Recent implementation of an Outlook Report provides regular, formal review of environmental condition and management and links to policy responses, key aspects of adaptive management. Given the major threat posed by climate change, the expanded network of marine reserves provides a critical and cost-effective contribution to enhancing the resilience of the Great Barrier Reef.},

This risks the possibility of preemptive resource extraction before the conservation intervention goes into force. We use a high-resolution dataset of satellite-based fishing activity to show that anticipation of an impending no-take marine reserve undermines the policy by triggering an unintended race-to-fish. We study one of the world's largest marine reserves, the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA), and find that fishers more than doubled their fishing effort once this area was earmarked for eventual protected status. The additional fishing effort resulted in an impoverished starting point for PIPA equivalent to 1.5 y of banned fishing. Extrapolating this behavior globally, we estimate that if other marine reserve announcements were to trigger similar preemptive fishing, this could temporarily increase the share of overextracted fisheries from 65\% to 72\%. Our findings have implications for general conservation efforts as well as the methods that scientists use to monitor and evaluate policy efficacy.},

However, resource managers in small-scale fisheries often lack the expertise and financial resources required to design and implement an effective enforcement system. Here, a bio-economic model is developed to investigate optimal levels of fishery enforcement and financing mechanisms available to recover costs of enforcement. The model is parameterized to represent a small-scale Caribbean lobster fishery, and optimal fishery enforcement levels for three different stakeholder archetypes are considered: (1) a fishing industry only; (2) a dive tourism industry only; and (3) fishing and dive tourism industries. For the illustrative small-scale fishery presented, the optimal level of fishery enforcement decreases with increasing levels of biomass, and is higher when a dive tourism industry is present. Results also indicate that costs of fisheries enforcement can be recovered through a suite of financing mechanisms. However, the timescale over which financing becomes sustainable will depend largely on the current status of the fishery resource. This study may serve as a framework that can be used by resource managers to help design and finance economically optimal fisheries enforcement systems.},

These types of decisions often need to be confronted in a data-limited context, where few if any management measures are currently in place or fisheries are managed independent of adequate scientific advice. This situation can sometimes create a high risk of overfishing and potential loss of economic and social benefits. To address this situation, simple model-free indicator-based frameworks have the potential to be effective decision-making platforms for fisheries where quantitative estimates of biomass and fishing mortality based reference points are lacking. In this paper, a multi-indicator framework is developed that enables decision-makers to proceed with management decisions in data-limited situations. Model-free indicators are calculated using trends in observed data, rather than stock assessment derived estimates of biomass and fishing mortality. The framework developed is adaptive so that adjustments to catch or effort are recursive and can respond to changing environments, socioeconomic conditions, and fishing practices. Using stakeholder-defined objectives as a foundation, indicators and reference points of fishery performance are chosen that can be evaluated easily by undertaking analyses of available data. Indicators from multiple data streams are used so that uncertainty in one indicator can be hedged through careful interpretation and corroboration of information from alternative indicators. During the adaptive management cycle, managers and stakeholders evaluate each indicator against the associated reference points to determine performance measures, interpret the results using scientific and local knowledge, and adjust fishery management tactics accordingly using pre-defined harvest control rules. The framework facilitates the interpretation of situations in which performance measures suggest divergent stock abundance or productivity levels. A case study is presented on this framework's development for conch and lobster fisheries of Belize.},

Their ratio is the weight of an average harvested individual which, in turn, reflects mean mortality rate.

The model developed for the South Australian rock lobster (\emph{Jasus edwardsii}) fishery assumes steady state, constant fishing mortality on all age classes and a natural mortality rate equal to 0\&\#183;1. Also explicit are reduced vulnerability of recruitment-aged lobsters and incidental mortality of lobsters below the legal minimum size. The solution yields estimates of average exploitation rate and yearly recruitment. These give (absolute) age-specific population numbers in the fishable stock. Exploitation rates were estimated for statistical reporting blocks in South Australia using this catch weight\&\#8211;numbers (qR) method and, for comparison, that of Beverton and Holt employing mean length. Each method was also tested with simulated data, the former yielding estimates of lower variance and bias. In practice, counting individuals captured is likely to require less time and to yield lower measurement error than measuring lengths. This method thus offers the possibility for improved precision and accuracy at lower cost.},

Previous evaluations of the performance of spatial management alternatives have not considered catastrophic events.

A spatial population dynamics model is used to explore effects of large, catastrophic natural mortality events. The effects of the spatial spread, magnitude, probability of catastrophe, and persistence of a catastrophic event through time are explored. Catastrophic events affecting large spatial areas and those that persist through time have the greatest effects on population dynamics because they affect natural mortality nonlinearly, whereas the probability and magnitude of catastrophic events result in only linear increases in natural mortality. The probability of falling below 10\% or 20\% of unfished abundance was greatest when a no-take marine reserve was implemented with no additional fishing regulations and least when a no-take marine reserve was implemented in addition to the maintenance of optimal fishing mortality in fished areas. In the absence of implementation error, maintaining abundance across space using restrictions on fishing mortality rates, regardless of the existence of a no-take marine reserve, decreased the probability of falling below 10\% or 20\% of unfished abundance.},

  note = {"Our central effort here is to begin to think, in a very preliminary and programmatic way, about an area which has received surprisingly little formal and empirical attentions specifically, the dynamics of local resource use under exogenously imposed and enforced formal regulation. In short, we want to reexamine Hardin's discredited 'Leviathan,' a theoretical baby which most anthropologists, in their unstoppable quest for locally emergent solutions to commons problems 'local compliance rules' and their disciplinary suspicion of 'state intervention,' have thrown out with the bathwater. Given the tenacity of the 'state' in the real world, of the persistence of externally imposed regulatory regimes, we ought to be developing empirically-informed non-compliance theories.

  "Economists, quite recently, have immersed themselves in that bathwater, developing one or another variant of an enforcement/avoidance theory--EAT, for ease of reference--and even occasionally attempting to measure the costs of implementing and breaking rules. The difficulties of measurement should not be underestimated: what we are dealing with of course is by definition illegal activity, clearly on the part of the avoiders, and, as we will suggest later, perhaps on the part of enforcers as well. But these measurement problems need not deter us from some conceptual speculations on what ought to be studied and measured by, we would hope, anthropologists as well as economists.

Here, we compile the best available information on MPA network design and supplement it with specific recommendations for building resilience into these networks. We provide guidance on size, spacing, shape, risk spreading (representation and replication), critical areas, connectivity, and maintaining ecosystem function to help MPA planners and managers design MPA networks that are more robust in the face of climate-change impacts.},

Extensive loss of reef corals following recent mass bleaching events have challenged the notion that support of system resilience is a viable reef management strategy. While resilience-based management (RBM) cannot prevent the damaging effects of major disturbances, such as mass bleaching events, it can support natural processes that promote resistance and recovery. Here, we review the potential of RBM to help sustain coral reefs in the 21st century. We explore the scope for supporting resilience through existing management approaches and emerging technologies and discuss their opportunities and limitations in a changing climate. We argue that for RBM to be effective in a changing world, reef management strategies need to involve both existing and new interventions that together reduce stress, support the fitness of populations and species, and help people and economies to adapt to a highly altered ecosystem.},

Here, based on spatially explicit simulations, we investigated whether selection to remain in MRs to avoid higher fishing mortality can lead to the evolution of more philopatric fish. Our simulations, which covered a range of life histories among tuna species (skipjack tuna vs. Atlantic bluefin tuna) and shark species (great white sharks vs. spiny dogfish), suggested that MRs were most effective at maintaining viable population sizes when movement distances were lowest. Decreased movement rate evolved following the establishment of marine reserves, and this evolution occurred more rapidly with higher fishing pressure. Evolutionary reductions in movement rate led to increases in within-reserve population sizes over the course of the 50 years following MR establishment, although this varied among life histories, with skipjack responding fastest and great white sharks slowest. Our results suggest the evolution of decreased movement can augment the efficacy of marine reserves, especially for species, such as skipjack tuna, with relatively short generation times. Even when movement rates did not evolve substantially over 50 years (e.g., given long generation times or little heritable variation), marine reserves were an effective tool for the conservation of fish populations when mean movement rates were low or MRs were large.},

We particularly elucidate which processes amplify or dampen spatial and temporal variation in that production within and between ecosystems. This paper attempts to assess the contribution of marine comparative ecosystem analysis to knowledge of the factors that affect the structure and function of marine ecosystems. We introduce the reader to the special volume, briefly highlighting the manuscripts in this special issue as organized by various thematic emphases. Papers in this volume are reviewed and briefly summarized with respect to current approaches, applications, opportunities, and lessons learned. Several approaches, applied to ecosystems over different spatial and temporal periods as well as the application of innovative statistical methods, facilitated comparisons and revealed basic underlying patterns that would not have been observable if only one ecosystem had been examined. Results imply that deeper eastern ocean boundary systems are more strongly influenced by bottom-up forcing; that shallower western ocean boundary systems, mainly continental shelves, are more strongly influenced by top-down forcing; and that synchronous events have taken place around the world's oceans. In many examples, it appears as if fisheries landings have shifted in emphasis from groundfish to invertebrates and that fish communities have shifted from a demersal to pelagic dominated groups. The benthos is an important, but understudied component of most ecosystems. We advocate database standardization at the onset of comparative studies as a mechanism to facilitate effective comparisons in future studies. Effective marine ecosystem comparisons require large, multi-national collaborations.},

We used a global meta-analysis of 345 stocks to assess whether fisheries under catch shares were more likely to track management targets set for sustainable harvest than fisheries managed only by fleet-wide quota caps or effort controls. We examined three ratios: catch-to-quota, current exploitation rate to target exploitation rate and current biomass to target biomass. For each, we calculated the mean response, variation around the target and the frequency of undesirable outcomes with respect to these targets. Regional effects were stronger than any other explanatory variable we examined. After accounting for region, we found the effects of catch shares primarily on catch-to-quota ratios: these ratios were less variable over time than in other fisheries. Over-exploitation occurred in only 9\% of stocks under catch shares compared to 13\% of stocks under fleet-wide quota caps. Additionally, over-exploitation occurred in 41\% of stocks under effort controls, suggesting a substantial benefit of quota caps alone. In contrast, there was no evidence for a response in the biomass of exploited populations because of either fleet-wide quota caps or individual catch shares. Thus, for many fisheries, management controls improve under catch shares in terms of reduced variation in catch around quota targets, but ecological benefits in terms of increased biomass may not be realized by catch shares alone.},

  abstract = {There is considerable variability in the status of fish populations around the world and a poor understanding of how specific management characteristics affect populations. Overfishing is a major problem in many fisheries, but in some regions the recent tendency has been to exploit stocks at levels  below  their maximum sustainable yield. In Western North American groundfish fisheries, the status of individual stocks and management systems among regions are highly variable. In this paper, we show the current status of groundfish stocks from Alaska, British Columbia, and the U.S. West Coast, and quantify the influence on stock status of six management tactics often hypothesized to affect groundfish. These tactics are: the use of harvest control rules with estimated biological reference points; seasonal closures; marine reserves; bycatch constraints; individual quotas (i.e., `catch shares'); and gear type. Despite the high commercial value of many groundfish and consequent incentives for maintaining stocks at their most productive levels, most stocks were managed extremely conservatively, with current exploitation rates at only 40\% of management targets and biomass 33\% above target biomass on average. Catches rarely exceeded TACs but on occasion were far below TACs (mean catch : TAC ratio of 57\%); approximately \$150 million of potential landed value was foregone annually by underutilizing TACs. The use of individual quotas, marine reserves, and harvest control rules with estimated limit reference points had little overall effect on stock status. More valuable fisheries were maintained closer to management targets and were less variable over time than stocks with lower catches or ex-vessel prices. Together these results suggest there is no single effective management measure for meeting conservation objectives; if scientifically established quotas are set and enforced, a variety of means can be used to ensure that exploitation rates and biomass levels are near to or more conservative than management targets.},

This diversity in the degree of harvest rights may influence the effectiveness of IQ fisheries to meet management objectives. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 167 stocks managed under IQs to test whether the strength of harvest rights impacts the conservation status of stocks in terms of catch, exploitation rate and biomass relative to management targets. We used non-parametric methods to assess non-linear relationships and linear regression models to explicitly consider interactions among predictors. Most IQ fisheries consistently met fleet-wide quota limits (94\% of stocks had recent catches below or within 10\% of quotas), but only 2/3 of IQ fisheries adhered to sustainable management targets for biomass and exploitation rate (68\% of stocks had exploitation rates below or within 10\% of targets and 63\% of stocks had biomass above or within 10\% of biomass targets). Strikingly, when exclusivity of the harvesting privilege was low, exploitation rates depended on whether IQ implementation was industry-driven (exploitation below targets) or government-mandated (exploitation above targets). At high levels of exclusivity, exploitation rates converged to just below management targets. Transferability of quota units was associated with stock biomass closer to and slightly above target levels than stocks with non-transferable quota. However, regional differences had the strongest effect on biomass, suggesting that other management or biological attributes of regional fishery systems have greater influence on marine populations.},

  abstract = {Economic dimensions of global fishery analyses are often limited by unavailable or inconsistent ex-vessel price data from the world's fishing nations. We describe a novel method for estimating ex-vessel price time series for individual species by converting export prices of fishery commodities into ex-vessel prices and pairing these with species. The method relies exclusively on global, publicly-available data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO). National datasets of ex-vessel prices are not used as inputs for the method, but comparisons of reconstructed ex-vessel prices with actual prices from national datasets showed strong correspondence. Correlation coefficients for paired reconstructed prices and actual prices of the same species were typically between 0.60 and 0.75 annually in the past two decades. There was a tendency for reconstructed prices to be less variable than actual prices, over-estimating actual prices at low values of actual prices and under-estimating actual prices at high values, likely the result of incomplete price transmission or assigning a given price time series to multiple species. However, there was no evidence of overall bias between reconstructed prices and actual prices, and correlations were strongest for comparisons involving multiple taxonomic groups. The method described carries advantages of global comprehensiveness and consistency across countries in reconstructed ex-vessel prices, reflecting the comprehensiveness and consistency of export price information. The method described links to species from the global FAO landings database, but can be modified to pair with other species lists or to focus on specific regions or countries. Data tables and source code are publicly available and ex-vessel price estimates can be updated annually following annual releases of the FAO fishery commodities database.},

New England's iconic cod populations have been in decline for several decades and have recently reached unprecedented lows. We find that 17\% of the overall decline in Gulf of Maine cod biomass since 1980 can be attributed to positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This is a consequence of three results: i) a 1-unit increase in the NAO winter index is associated with a 17\% decrease in the spring biomass of age-1 cod the following year; ii) this NAO-driven decrease persists as the affected cohort matures; iii) fishing practices appear to exacerbate NAO's direct biological effect such that, since 1913, a 1-unit increase in the NAO index lowers subsequent cod catch for up to 19 years. The Georges Bank cod stock displays similar patterns. Because we statistically detect a delay between the NAO and subsequent declines in adult biomass, our findings imply that observed current NAO conditions can be used in stock forecasts, providing lead time for adaptive policy. More broadly, our approach can inform forecasting efforts for other fish populations strongly affected by natural and anthropogenic climatic variation.},

Spending both public and private funds, such institutions frequently acquire less than full title by purchasing or accepting donations of conservation easements. These title and organizational arrangements are evolving so fast that it is difficult to assess their conservation accomplishments and long-term viability. To understand the contribution of these arrangements to the preservation and restoration of biodiversity, conservation biologists need to identify the biological resources likely to be conserved and those likely to be left unprotected through easements held by land trusts. We describe land trusts and conservation easements and why they are currently an attractive approach to land protection. Our review of the literature showed that little information is available on (1) the resulting pattern of protected lands and resources being conserved, (2) the emerging institutions that hold conservation easements and the landowners they work with, and (3) the distribution of costs and benefits of land trusts and easements to communities and the general public. The prescriptive literature on how to establish land trusts and negotiate easements is extensive. However, easily available information on protected resources is too aggregated to determine what is actually being conserved, and more detailed data is widely scattered and hence difficult to synthesize. The social science literature provides some insight into the motives of landowners who participate but offers little about the variety of institutions or which type of institution works best in particular ecological and political settings. Equally undeveloped is our understanding of the inherent tension between the public and private benefits of this widely used incentive-based conservation strategy. Interdisciplinary research is needed to determine the ecological and social consequences of acquiring partial interest in private land for conservation purposes.},

  abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided.},

The governance systems in place for marine fisheries and for the marine environment, more broadly, will be critical in determining the extent to which these resources can be managed for sustainability. The paper focuses on the governance of internationally shared fisheries, and draws on a body of game-theoretic research to discuss present-day governance problems and to evaluate the implications of global environmental change for future efforts to maintain cooperative and effective governance of shared fishery resources. In particular, the increased likelihood of abrupt and unpredictable changes in the productive potential and migratory behavior of exploited fish stocks may threaten to disrupt cooperative management arrangements. The paper discusses the value of contingency planning based on anticipation of the possibility of such events and concludes with a discussion of future directions for both research and policy development.},

We examine fishers' responses to the introduction of tradable harvest rights for protected species, `bycatch rights,' in the US West Coast groundfish fishery, finding evidence of adjustment along several margins and estimating the marginal cost of conservation. Fishers adapted to bycatch rights by changing fishing location, gear, time of day fished, and duration of fishing activity. As a result, catches of protected species fell dramatically. The nuanced nature of fishers' responses indicates that the least-cost way of achieving conservation goals can involve fine-tuned behavioral adaptations that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with command-and-control regulation.},

Based on the generalized information criterion, the ZINB regression model provided a better fit to the data than either Poisson, negative binomial or zero-inflated Poisson regression models. To demonstrate the utility of the ZINB regression model for the standardization of catch data, standardized temporal trends in bycatch rates estimated with the ZINB regression model are computed and compared to those obtained from fits of the other three types of models to the same data. With the exception of the negative binomial, estimated temporal trends were more similar among models than would have been inferred from an analysis of model fit.

Nevertheless, it is unknown whether the network of protected areas in the United States is connected in a way that will preserve biodiversity over large temporal and spatial scales. It is also unclear whether protected-area networks that function for larger species will function for smaller species. We assessed the connectivity of protected areas in the three largest biomes in the United States. With methods from graph theory\textemdash{}a branch of mathematics that deals with connectivity and flow\textemdash{}we identified and measured networks of protected areas for three different groups of mammals. We also examined the value of using umbrella species (typically large-bodied, far-ranging mammals) in designing large-scale networks of protected areas. Although the total amount of protected land varied greatly among biomes in the United States, overall connectivity did not. In general, protected-area networks were well connected for large mammals but not for smaller mammals. Additionally, it was not possible to predict connectivity for small mammals on the basis of connectivity for large mammals, which suggests the umbrella species approach may not be an appropriate design strategy for conservation networks intended to protect many species. Our findings indicate different strategies should be used to increase the likelihood of persistence for different groups of species. Strategic linkages of existing lands should be a conservation priority for smaller mammals, whereas conservation of larger mammals would benefit most from the protection of more land.},

The focus was on a design that is costeffective and produces relatively accurate and precise density estimates for the largest number of species. We evaluated the 2 most widely used shapes of sampling units (strip transects and stationary cylinders) of several dimensions on a fringing reef at Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, tropical West Atlantic. Small sampling units produced the best density estimates for small fishes, while large ones produced the best estimates for large fishes, regardless of sampling unit shape. The sampling unit with the lowest cost was the stationary cylinder. We further compared accuracy and precision of density and richness estimates from several combinations of stationary cylinders and fish size. A simple improvement in stationary censuses, i.e. a sampling unit composed of 2 nested cylinders (2 m and 4 m radii, respectively), enhanced the accuracy and precision of estimates. Counts of small fish ({$\leq$}10 cm) were made in the smaller cylinder and counts of larger fish ({$>$}10 cm) were made in the larger. Such nested cylinders reduce the bias towards large and conspicuous species and allow for separate density estimates for adults and juveniles of large species.},

  abstract = {Weighting of size-composition data (length or weight composition of the catches) can have a large influence on the results of contemporary integrated stock assessment models in the presence of model misspecification. Model misspecification leads to conflicting information among data sets, and the choice of data weighting will determine the results. Information content on absolute abundance and abundance trends contained in size-composition data is particularly susceptible to misspecification of the biological processes. Biological processes are often misspecified in assessment models for exploited fish stocks due to lack of information. The misspecification can be in a functional form (e.g., the growth curve) or in the values assumed for pre-specified parameters. Our application to bigeye tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean shows how one needs to ``get the biology right'', i.e. minimize model misspecification, to reduce the dependency of stock assessment results on the weighting of the various data components. The stock assessment results are sensitive to the conversion from processed weight to total weight, a common, but often overlooked, component of model specification, and to the asymptotic length of the growth curve. The results are also sensitive to the weighting of the composition data. Application of the Age-Structured Production Model diagnostic shows that recruitment variation must be taken into account to interpret the absolute abundance and trend information contained in a CPUE-based index of relative abundance. Unfortunately, recruitment cannot typically be estimated from the relative index of abundance alone, so composition data are needed. The abundance estimates from an age-structured production model with estimated recruitment deviates are too uncertain (i.e., have wide confidence intervals) to be of use for management advice. Therefore, there is a trade-off between using composition data to estimate recruitment and its influence on estimates of absolute abundance through a catch-curve type process. We conclude that (i) integrated analysis, the current approach for assessing fish stocks, is supported by our results; (ii) composition data are needed to estimate recruitment; and (iii) addressing key model misspecifications should be a major component of integrated analysis.},

  abstract = {To understand the processes that regulate the abundance and persistence of wild populations is a fundamental goal of ecology and a prerequisite for the management of living resources. Variable abundance data, however, make the demonstration of regulation processes challenging1,2,3. A previously overlooked aspect in understanding how populations are regulated4,5,6 is the possibility that the pattern of variability\textemdash{}its strength as a function of population size\textemdash{}may be more than `noise', thus revealing much about the characteristics of population regulation. Here we show that patterns in survival variability do provide evidence of regulation through density. Using a large, global compilation of marine, anadromous and freshwater fisheries data, we examine the relationship between the variability of survival and population abundance. The interannual variability in progeny survival increases at low adult abundance in an inversely density-dependent fashion. This pattern is consistent with models in which density dependence enters after the larval stage. The findings are compatible with very simple forms of density dependence: even a linear increase of juvenile mortality with adult density adequately explains the results. The model predictions explain why populations with strong regulation may experience large increases in variability at low densities7. Furthermore, the inverse relationship between survival variability and the strength of density dependence has important consequences for fisheries management and recovery, and population persistence or extinction8,9,10.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an updated review of world tuna fisheries. Previous studies (Miyake et al., 2004) discussed the historical development of tuna fisheries, described current world tuna fisheries, and explained the technological developments that have affected fishing operations. The current paper expands the discussion to include socioeconomic aspects of the tuna industry as a whole, specifically including recent changes in processing, trade, marketing and consumer preferences. The first half of the paper introduces the conditions under which the studies were made and the data sources. It first provides caveats and assumptions which are designed to prevent misunderstanding or misinterpretation when using the data. It then reviews the world tuna stock status based on the results of Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) scientific reviews. Even though the biomass of most of the world's tuna stocks is generally above but close to the reference point, for a few stocks fishing mortality is above the maximum sustainable yield level indicating that the stock is being overfished. World tuna fisheries (mostly longline, purse seine and baitboat [pole-and-line] fisheries) are reviewed from the standpoint of catches, technological developments and economics. Finally, tuna management measures taken by RFMOs are reviewed, including those used to mitigate bycatch. Gear and species interactions are specifically discussed in terms of allocations of the stocks between fisheries. The second half of the paper analyses tuna trade, processing, markets, consumption, price and profits for sashimi, fresh tuna steak, katsuobushi (dried skipjack stick) and canned tuna. The marketing of sashimi has changed very substantially from an exclusive Japanese market to a global one. The marketing system is also changing, because instead of being sold in market auctions, entire catches are now bought by one dealer and sold to large supermarkets or other retailers. This trend has had a clear impact on price and has resulted in the reduction of landing values. In the fresh and frozen steak tuna industry, in general, the price of tuna per unit weight is far higher than for canned materials. Since the 1960s, the production of, and demand and market for, canned tuna has increased very rapidly, accompanied by the rapid development of purse seine fisheries in tropical waters. The largest consumer of canned tuna in the 1970s was by far the United States of America, but these levels have been exceeded by European Union markets in the last two decades. The relative importance of the major markets (the United States, the European Union and Japan) has been continuously declining as a percentage of the world market. These trends have been accompanied by the concentration of capital. Another major change has involved the relocation of tuna factories from developed countries to areas closer to raw materials. This also helped the industry by cutting labour and transshipment costs, and facilitated flexible export marketing. Production was formerly dominated by the United States but as production has declined, Thailand has become the top producer in the late 1990s, followed by Spain, as a result of newly developed canning materials in the form of loins. In conclusion, because of the recent rapid increase in competition among fisheries, species, industries and even products (sashimi/fresh tuna vs. canned), the most important and most urgent issue is how to manage and allocate tuna resources among these competitors (e.g. using fishing capacity control measures and/or catch allocations). In order to achieve such an objective it is imperative that socio-economic and ecological considerations are integrated into decision-making processes alongside capacity and allocation issues. This study does not address the broad socio-economic importance of the tuna industry to the countries in which it operates, but this type of research will be necessary in future in order to solve current fishery management problems},

There are now a number of studies examining the conditions under which marine reserves can provide both economic and ecological benefits.  A potentially important reality of fishing that these studies overlook is that fishing can damage the habitat of the target stock.  Here, we construct an equilibrium bioeconomic model that incorporates this habitat damage, and show that the designation of marine reserves, coupled with the implementation of a tax on fishing effort, becomes both biologically and economically favorable as habitat sensitivity increases.  We also study the effects of varied degrees of spatial control on fisheries management.  Together, our results provide further evidence for the potential monetary and biological value of spatial management, and the possibility of a mutually-beneficial resolution to the fisherman-conservationist marine reserve designation dilemma.},

Because there are opportunity costs to conservation, there is a need for science-based assessment of MPAs. Here, we present one of the northernmost documentations of MPA effects to date, demonstrated by a replicated before\textendash{}after control-impact (BACI) approach. In 2006, MPAs were implemented along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast offering complete protection to shellfish and partial protection to fish. By 2010, European lobster (Homarus gammarus) catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) had increased by 245 per cent in MPAs, whereas CPUE in control areas had increased by 87 per cent. Mean size of lobsters increased by 13 per cent in MPAs, whereas increase in control areas was negligible. Furthermore, MPA-responses and population development in control areas varied significantly among regions. This illustrates the importance of a replicated BACI design for reaching robust conclusions and management decisions. Partial protection of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was followed by an increase in population density and body size compared with control areas. By 2010, MPA cod were on average 5 cm longer than in any of the control areas. MPAs can be useful management tools in rebuilding and conserving portions of depleted lobster populations in northern temperate waters, and even for a mobile temperate fish species such as the Atlantic cod.},

Implementing ecosystem-based fisheries management: from single-species to integrated ecosystem assessment and advice for Baltic Sea fish stocks. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fst123. Theory behind ecosystem-based management (EBM) and ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) is now well developed. However, the implementation of EBFM exemplified by fisheries management in Europe is still largely based on single-species assessments and ignores the wider ecosystem context and impact. The reason for the lack or slow implementation of EBM and specifically EBFM is a lack of a coherent strategy. Such a strategy is offered by recently developed integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs), a formal synthesis tool to quantitatively analyse information on relevant natural and socio-economic factors, in relation to specified management objectives. Here, we focus on implementing the IEA approach for Baltic Sea fish stocks. We combine both tactical and strategic management aspects into a single strategy that supports the present Baltic Sea fish stock advice, conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). We first review the state of the art in the development of IEA within the current management framework. We then outline and discuss an approach that integrates fish stock advice and IEAs for the Baltic Sea. We intentionally focus on the central Baltic Sea and its three major fish stocks cod (Gadus morhua), herring (Clupea harengus), and sprat (Sprattus sprattus), but emphasize that our approach may be applied to other parts and stocks of the Baltic, as well as other ocean areas.},

Marine reserves are widely used for conservation and fisheries management. However, there is debate surrounding the speed of population recovery inside reserves and how recovery differs among species. Here, we determine how reserve effectiveness in enhancing fish density changes with reserve age. We also examine how the effects of protection vary between fished and non-fished species and among species of different body sizes, which we use as a proxy for life history and ecology.
2.
We meta-analysed over 1000 ratios of fish densities (inside~:~outside reserves) taken from reserves of 1\textendash{}26~years old from around the world.
3.
Overall, older reserves were more effective than younger reserves, with fish densities increasing within reserves by {$\sim$}5\% per annum relative to unprotected areas. Reserves older than 15~years consistently harboured more fish compared with unprotected areas; younger reserves were less reliably effective.
4.
Large, fished species responded strongly and positively to protection in old ({$>$}15~years) and, unexpectedly, in new and young ({$\leq$}10~years) reserves. Small, fished species and non-fished species of all sizes showed weaker responses to protection that did not vary predictably with reserve age.
5.
We expected large fish to respond more slowly to protection than smaller species. We also expected small species to decline after large fish had recovered (i.e. trophic cascades). Neither prediction was supported.
6.

Synthesis and applications. Our meta-analyses demonstrate that, globally, old reserves are more effective than young reserves at increasing fish densities. Our results imply that reserves should be maintained for up to 15~years following establishment, even if they initially appear ineffective. If protection is maintained for long enough, fish densities within reserves will recover and such benefits will be particularly pronounced for large, locally fished species.},

  abstract = {Statistical inference is a widely-used, powerful tool for learning about natural processes in diverse fields. The statistical software platforms AD Model Builder (ADMB) and Template Model Builder (TMB) are particularly popular in the ecological literature, where they are typically used to perform frequentist inference of complex models. However, both lack capabilities for flexible and efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. Recently, the no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) MCMC algorithm has gained popularity for Bayesian inference through the software Stan because it is efficient for high dimensional, complex hierarchical models. Here, we introduce the R packages adnuts and tmbstan, which provide NUTS sampling in parallel and interactive diagnostics with ShinyStan. The ADMB source code was modified to provide NUTS, while TMB models are linked directly into Stan. We describe the packages, provide case studies demonstrating their use, and contrast performance against Stan. For TMB models, we show how to test the accuracy of the Laplace approximation using NUTS. For complex models, the performance of ADMB and TMB was typically within +/- 50\% the speed of Stan. In one TMB case study we found inaccuracies in the Laplace approximation, potentially leading to biased inference. adnuts provides a new method for estimating hierarchical ADMB models which previously were infeasible. TMB users can fit the same model in both frequentist and Bayesian paradigms, including using NUTS to test the validity of the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood for arbitrary subsets of parameters. These software developments extend the available statistical methods of the ADMB and TMB user base with no additional effort by the user.},

Projected increases in greenhouse gas emissions could suppress marine biological productivity for a thousand years or more. As the climate warms, westerly winds in the Southern Hemisphere will strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters will warm, and sea ice will disappear. Moore et al. suggest that one effect of these changes will be a dramatic decrease in marine biological productivity (see the Perspective by Laufk{\"o}tter and Gruber). This decrease will result from a global-scale redistribution of nutrients, with a net transfer to the deep ocean. By 2300, this could drive declines in fisheries yields by more than 20\% globally and by nearly 60\% in the North Atlantic.
Science, this issue p. 1139; see also p. 1103
Climate change projections to the year 2100 may miss physical-biogeochemical feedbacks that emerge later from the cumulative effects of climate warming. In a coupled climate simulation to the year 2300, the westerly winds strengthen and shift poleward, surface waters warm, and sea ice disappears, leading to intense nutrient trapping in the Southern Ocean. The trapping drives a global-scale nutrient redistribution, with net transfer to the deep ocean. Ensuing surface nutrient reductions north of 30\textdegree{}S drive steady declines in primary production and carbon export (decreases of 24 and 41\%, respectively, by 2300). Potential fishery yields, constrained by lower\textendash{}trophic-level productivity, decrease by more than 20\% globally and by nearly 60\% in the North Atlantic. Continued high levels of greenhouse gas emissions could suppress marine biological productivity for a millennium.

While multiple frameworks have been developed for selecting and evaluating indicators, certain types of indicators require additional consideration and validation. In particular, an index, which we define as an aggregation of two or more indicators, may have unique properties and behaviors that can make interpretation difficult, particularly in a management context. We assert that more rigorous validation and testing is required for indices, particularly those used to inform management decisions. To support this point we demonstrate the need for validation and then explore current development and validation processes for ecosystem indices. We also compare how other disciplines (e.g., medicine, economics) validate indices. Validating indices (and indicators) is particularly challenging because they are often developed without an explicit objective in mind. We suggest that exploring the sensitivity of an index to the assumptions made during its development be a pre-requisite to employing such an index.},

  abstract = {Recent shifts in the geographic distribution of marine species have been linked to shifts in preferred thermal habitats. These shifts in distribution have already posed challenges for living marine resource management, and there is a strong need for projections of how species might be impacted by future changes in ocean temperatures during the 21st century. We modeled thermal habitat for 686 marine species in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans using long-term ecological survey data from the North American continental shelves. These habitat models were coupled to output from sixteen general circulation models that were run under high (RCP 8.5) and low (RCP 2.6) future greenhouse gas emission scenarios over the 21st century to produce 32 possible future outcomes for each species. The models generally agreed on the magnitude and direction of future shifts for some species (448 or 429 under RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6, respectively), but strongly disagreed for other species (116 or 120 respectively). This allowed us to identify species with more or less robust predictions. Future shifts in species distributions were generally poleward and followed the coastline, but also varied among regions and species. Species from the U.S. and Canadian west coast including the Gulf of Alaska had the highest projected magnitude shifts in distribution, and many species shifted more than 1000 km under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Following a strong mitigation scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement would likely produce substantially smaller shifts and less disruption to marine management efforts. Our projections offer an important tool for identifying species, fisheries, and management efforts that are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts.},

  abstract = {One approach to better account for ecosystem considerations in fisheries science is to incorporate ecological interactions into conventional stock assessment models. The longfin inshore squid Loligo pealeii is one of two squid species of ecological and commercial significance in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. A surplus production model with quarterly time steps was fitted to longfin inshore squid total removal (fishing and predation removal) and tuned with fishery-dependent, fishery-independent, and predation-dependent indices to examine the effect of incorporating predation into a single-species model. Total consumption of squid by all predatory fish exceeded the landings in most years of this analysis. The model output indicated that biological reference points for longfin inshore squid differ considerably when predation removals are included. It appears that by not including predation, the model underestimates stock biomass and overestimates fishery surplus production. Short-term stochastic projections of such estimates demonstrate that increasing predation mortality and fishing mortality will decrease the biomass of longfin inshore squid. Failing to account for predation when performing stock assessments for longfin inshore squid and other similar forage species may misrepresent reference point estimates and result in management advice that could lead to biomass declines. We envision that the approach presented here will provide requisite information and a useful example towards improving the current modeling practices for longfin inshore squid and similar forage species.},

  abstract = {Understanding catch trends through time is a crucial management consideration that would ensure long term sustainability of the fisheries. This study describes some changes in small-scale fisheries in the Philippines over the past five decades using both "quantitative" and "qualitative" estimates of current and past daily catches. "Quantitative" estimate was determined as the difference between current and past catches in kg per trip, as reported by fishers, on a normal fishing day. "Qualitative" estimate, on the other hand, was determined by asking fishers whether current catches are (i) less than half, (ii) lower to 50\%, or (iii) the same or higher than past levels. "Quantitative estimate" indicated that current catches are lower by 16{$\pm$}14\% of the 2000\textendash{}2010 levels and 24{$\pm$}13\textendash{}26{$\pm$}19\% of catch levels in the preceding four decades. Catch decline over the past five decades was much worse based on "qualitative" estimate. The relatively more stable catches from "quantitative" estimate could be attributed to the improvement in fishing strategies employed by fishers to keep catches high even as the fish stocks continue to decline. The results of the study further suggest that the condition of small-scale fisheries in the Philippines has been deteriorating since the 1970s but initial signs of severe depletion of fish stocks to the level indicative of biological and economic overfishing occurred in 1990s. Increasing fishing population was attributed as the main cause of fishery decline. Other factors include destructive fishing, large-scale fishing in coastal waters, climate change, siltation/pollution from land-based activities and even marine protected areas establishment and tourism activities that closed some traditional fishing grounds. Important insights and policy prescriptions for improved management of small-scale fisheries are further discussed.},

  abstract = {Managing small-scale fisheries in a developing country like the Philippines is very challenging because of high pressures from expanding fishing population, poverty and lack of alternative options. Thus, resource-focused fisheries management initiatives such as marine protected area (MPA) establishment will likely result in further marginalization of the poor fishers which could pose more serious problems in coastal communities. In this study, the status of small-scale fisheries in 44 coastal towns in the Philippines was assessed using FISHDA (Fishing Industries' Support in Handling Decisions Application), a simple decision support tool which requires minimal or easily-generated data. Results showed that 68\% (30 out of 44) of the studied towns have unsustainable fisheries unless 58\% of their fishing grounds are protected from all fishing activities. Alternatively, 53\% of the active fishers in towns with unsustainable fisheries must totally stop fishing to avert fishery collapse. Alarming as it may sound, this is still an underestimate as catches incurred by the highly efficient and destructive illegal fishing activities such as blast, poison and large-scale fishing, which are reported to be still rampant in many coastal areas in the Philippines, were not accounted for in this study. This study demonstrated that MPAs alone may not be enough to avert fishery collapse even if MPA size is increased from the current 3\% to 15\% of the municipal waters, i.e. up to 15 km from the shore, as required by the Philippine law. Various challenges confronting the fishery and important recommendations to address them are further discussed.},

  abstract = {We used time series of biomass and catches for the major commercial groundfish stocks in the Eastern Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands region and in the Gulf of Alaska to compute annual surplus production for 1977\textendash{}2004. Annual surplus production and average annual biomass were aggregated across stocks within each region to examine the relationship between total surplus production and total aggregated biomass. We fit two surplus production models (Graham-Schaefer and Pella-Tomlinson) to the observed relationships to estimate maximum multi-species surplus production (equivalent to maximum sustainable yield) of the groundfish complexes in these ecosystems. Maximum multi-species surplus production was estimated to be approximately 2.5\texttimes{}106t in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands and 330\texttimes{}103t in the Gulf of Alaska. These point estimates were smaller than the sum of single-species MSY proxies from recent stock assessments, and estimates for the Gulf of Alaska were much smaller than earlier estimates that were used to specify optimum yield ranges for the Gulf of Alaska groundfish complex. Therefore, optimum yield ranges for the Gulf of Alaska may need to be re-assessed to reflect more recent conditions. We further estimated the effects of environmental variability on annual surplus production using correlations and generalized surplus production models with environmental covariates. Results suggest that surplus production in the Bering Sea may be lower during conditions associated with the positive phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is characterized by warmer temperatures, reduced ice, and reduced wind mixing over the shelf. Similarly, surplus production on the Gulf of Alaska shelf was lower during years with warm bottom temperatures coupled with low salinities in late winter. If maximum multi-species surplus production varies as a result of environmental variability, optimum yield ranges for the groundfish complexes in these ecosystems should take such fluctuations into account.},

Here we describe the results of two biological oceanography research cruises conducted in winter-spring of 2006 and 2007, focusing on larval fish assemblages. We use multivariate assemblage analyses to examine vertical and horizontal distribution characteristics of larval fish assemblages, to highlight key distinguishing taxa, and to relate these to the observed oceanographic structure. Our results showed a general separation between the Gulf of Honduras region, which was characterized by weaker currents and high abundances of inshore and estuarine taxa (Eleotridae, Priacanthidae), and the northern MBRS, which was subject to strong northward flow and contained a mixture of mesopelagic and reef-associated taxa (Myctophidae, Sparidae). Although distinct patterns of vertical distribution were observed among taxa, both shallow and deep living larvae were broadly distributed throughout the study area. Analysis of historical drifter tracks highlighted the strong northward flow and low retention conditions typically present along the northern MBRS, as well as potential connectivity between the western Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean.},

Landings by fishing season, zone (upper Florida Keys and lower Florida Keys), sex, and time period (summer \emph{v.} winter) were pro-rated into numbers by length that were assigned ages by using growth simulations. From tag\&\#8211;recapture data, moult interval was estimated by using a logistic regression with terms for zone, sex, time period, carapace length, and time at large. For lobsters that moulted, the moult increment was modelled with a multiple regression including the same terms. Standardized catch-per-trip and total landings increased as traps were reduced. Age-structured analysis of the catches-at-age indicated that fishing mortality decreased by 16\%, even as landings increased. It is not known whether the increase in landings was due to natural population fluctuations or to positive results of trap reduction. Fishing mortality rates still exceed common benchmarks used in fishery management, and excessive traps remain in the fishery.},

Similarly, a VMS-based fishing catch per unit of effort (CPUE) index was developed for comparison with CPUE derived from logbooks. Analysis of these indices showed that VMS-based fishing effort and CPUE indices can be interpreted to provide reliable complementary or alternative indices to logbooks for assessment of fishery performance in the Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) fishery. We also developed a VMS-based index of fishing efficiency and illustrate how it can be applied toward understanding various behaviors and anomalies in the fishery.

The results indicate that the exclusion zone has failed to protect pre-recruit crabs largely due to a redistribution and intensification of directed Snow Crab effort inside the Box in the years following closure. This unexpected outcome resulted in a high level of fishery-induced mortality to pre-recruit crabs and masked any potential positive outcomes from the cessation of trawling. The shortcomings that contributed to the failure of this exclusion area are discussed in relation to the current state of knowledge on the effectiveness of marine protected areas in general as management tools for conserving aquatic resources.},

Because large-bodied parrotfishes escape the risk of predation from a large piscivore (the Nassau grouper), the predation effect reduced grazing by only 4 to 8\%. This impact was overwhelmed by the increase in density of large parrotfishes, resulting in a net doubling of grazing. Increased grazing caused a fourfold reduction in the cover of macroalgae, which, because they are the principal competitors of corals, highlights the potential importance of reserves for coral reef resilience.
Recovery of populations of large predators in Caribbean coral reef reserves unexpectedly leads to ecosystem restoration via increased algae grazing by fishes.

We applied this method to artificial data sets generated from a variety of parametric models and compare the results with the fit of Ricker and BevertonHolt models.

This is particularly problematic when ecological models are used to make conservation and management plans whose outcomes may depend strongly on model formulation. Nonlinear time series approaches allow us to circumvent this issue by using the observed dynamics of the system to guide policy development. However, these methods typically require long time series from stationary systems, which are rarely available in ecological settings. Here we present a Bayesian approach to nonlinear forecasting based on Gaussian processes that readily integrates information from several short time series and allows for nonstationary dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our modeling methods on simulated from a wide range of ecological scenarios. We expect that these models will extend the range of ecological systems to which nonlinear forecasting methods can be usefully applied.},

Despite this, we are not much closer to predicting recruitment. Rather, recent analyses suggest that recruitment is virtually independent of stock size and, instead, seems to occur in distinct environmental regimes. This issue of whether or not recruitment and subsequent production are coupled to stock size is highly relevant to management. Here, we apply empirical dynamical modelling (EDM) to a global database of 185 fish populations to address the questions of whether or not variation in recruitment is (a) predictable and (b) coupled to stock size. We find that a substantial fraction of recruitment variation is predictable using only the observed history of fluctuations ( 40\% on average). In addition, although recruitment is often coupled to stock size (107 of 185 stocks), stock size alone explains very little of the variation in recruitment; In 90\% of the stocks analysed, EDM forecasts have substantially lower prediction error than models based solely on stock size. We find that predictability varies across taxa and improves with the number of generations that have been sampled. In the light of these results, we suggest that EDM will be of greatest use in managing relatively short-lived species.},

Movement of a neutral marker gene provided an indicator of gene transfer between populations. Simulations showed that fishing may alter genetic connectivity.

Although existing concepts of overfishing have a strong theoretical basis for evaluating policy choices and much practical use, they do not provide direct guidance on issues such as biodiversity, serial depletion, habitat degradation, and changes in the food web caused by fishing. There is, however, little basis for defining optimum fishing by using related metrics such as diversity indices, slopes of size or diversity spectra, or average trophic level of the catch, and these may produce ambiguous results. If ecosystem-based overfishing concepts are to assume a greater role in management, unambiguous, quantifiable, and predictive measures of ecosystem state and flux must be developed to index: (1) biomass and production by the ecosystem and relationships among its parts, (2) diversity at different levels of organization, (3) patterns of resource variability, and (4) social and economic benefits. Ecosystem considerations do not need to substitute for existing overfishing concepts. Instead, they should be used to evaluate and modify primary management guidance for important fisheries and species. In practice, they emphasize the need to manage fishing capacity, supported by broader use of technical measures such as marine protected areas and gear restrictions.},

Why compare marine ecosystems? \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1\textendash{}9.Effective marine ecosystem-based management (EBM) requires understanding the key processes and relationships controlling the aspects of biodiversity, productivity, and resilience to perturbations. Unfortunately, the scales, complexity, and non-linear dynamics that characterize marine ecosystems often confound managing for these properties. Nevertheless, scientifically derived decision-support tools (DSTs) are needed to account for impacts resulting from a variety of simultaneous human activities. Three possible methodologies for revealing mechanisms necessary to develop DSTs for EBM are: (i) controlled experimentation, (ii) iterative programmes of observation and modelling (``learning by doing''), and (iii) comparative ecosystem analysis. We have seen that controlled experiments are limited in capturing the complexity necessary to develop models of marine ecosystem dynamics with sufficient realism at appropriate scales. Iterative programmes of observation, model building, and assessment are useful for specific ecosystem issues but rarely lead to generally transferable products. Comparative ecosystem analyses may be the most effective, building on the first two by inferring ecosystem processes based on comparisons and contrasts of ecosystem response to human-induced factors. We propose a hierarchical system of ecosystem comparisons to include within-ecosystem comparisons (utilizing temporal and spatial changes in relation to human activities), within-ecosystem-type comparisons (e.g. coral reefs, temperate continental shelves, upwelling areas), and cross-ecosystem-type comparisons (e.g. coral reefs vs. boreal, terrestrial vs. marine ecosystems). Such a hierarchical comparative approach should lead to better understanding of the processes controlling biodiversity, productivity, and the resilience of marine ecosystems. In turn, better understanding of these processes will lead to the development of increasingly general laws, hypotheses, functional forms, governing equations, and broad interpretations of ecosystem responses to human activities, ultimately improving DSTs in support of EBM.},

Networks of no-take marine reserves are promising management tools because of their potential to (1) protect coastal ecosystem structure and functioning, (2) benefit exploited populations and fisheries, (3) improve scientific understanding of marine ecosystems, and (4) provide enriched opportunities for non-extractive human activities. By protecting marine ecosystems and their populations, no-take reserve networks can reduce risk by providing important insurance for fishery managers against overexploitation of individual populations. Replicated reserves also foster strong scientific testing of fishery and conservation management strategies. Reserve networks will require social acceptance, adequate enforcement, and effective scientific evaluation to be successful. Processes for reserve establishment should accommodate adaptive management so boundaries and regulations can be modified to enhance performance. However, even well-designed reserve networks will require continued conservation efforts outside reserve boundaries to be effective. Establishing networks of no-take reserves is a process-oriented, precautionary management strategy that protects functional attributes of marine ecosystems. As an addition to fishery management practices and other conservation efforts, no-take reserve networks may improve the status of exploited populations while conserving marine resources for future generations.},

  abstract = {In this study we consider the problem of estimating, for management purposes, a minimum biomass reference level at which recruitment to a fish stock is seriously reduced. We take an empirical, comparative approach to the problem by examining observations on a wide range of fish stocks. Eight methods for estimating spawning stock biomass thresholds for recruitment overfishing are investigated. Their behaviour is tested using stock and recruitment data for 72 finfish populations, each with at least 20 years of data. We considered three classes of thresholds defined by: (1) the stock size corresponding to 50\% of the maximum predicted average recruitment; (2) the minimum stock size that would produce a good year class when environmental conditions are favourable; and (3) the stock size corresponding to 20\% of various estimates of virgin stock size. The estimators of the first type are generally preferable because they are easily understood, relatively robust if only data at low stock sizes are available, and almost always result in higher levels of recruitment above the threshold.},

We find that the number of spawners produced per spawner each year at low populations, i.e., the maximum annual reproductive rate, is relatively constant within species and that there is relatively little variation among species.

We employ variance components models that assume that the log of the standardized slope at the origin is a normal random variable.

In this article, we investigate three quantitative techniques for obtaining a prior distribution for steepness, a critical parameter in fisheries management. These techniques were developed in the context of a risk assessment of a power plant's impact on nine species of fish. All three techniques use mixed-effects models to estimate the parameters of the prior distributions, but they differ in the choice of the fish populations to include in the analysis. The first two methods use information from taxonomically similar and ecologically similar populations, respectively, to generate a prior distribution. The third method combines a mixed-effects model and a quantitative analysis of life history and environmental data to generate a prior distribution, using data from all available fish populations. These techniques represent an empirical Bayesian approach, which we preferred to a hierarchical Bayesian approach because it allowed us to rapidly explore numerous alternative model formulations.},

However, a major stock assessment of Hawaiian coral reef fish populations has not yet been conducted. Here we used the robust indicator variable ``average length in the exploited phase of the population (L\textasciimacron{})'', estimated from size composition data from commercial fisheries trip reports and fishery-independent diver surveys, to evaluate exploitation rates for 19 Hawaiian reef fishes. By and large, the average lengths obtained from diver surveys agreed well with those from commercial data. We used the estimated exploitation rates coupled with life history parameters synthesized from the literature to parameterize a numerical population model and generate stock sustainability metrics such as spawning potential ratios (SPR). We found good agreement between predicted average lengths in an unfished population (from our population model) and those observed from diver surveys in the largely unexploited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Of 19 exploited reef fish species assessed in the main Hawaiian Islands, 9 had SPRs close to or below the 30\% overfishing threshold. In general, longer-lived species such as surgeonfishes, the redlip parrotfish (Scarus rubroviolaceus), and the gray snapper (Aprion virescens) had the lowest SPRs, while short-lived species such as goatfishes and jacks, as well as two invasive species (Lutjanus kasmira and Cephalopholis argus), had SPRs above the 30\% threshold.},

  abstract = {Dispersal is a fundamental process governing the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of any given species. Due to inherent challenges associated with measuring dispersal directly, identifying proxies for dispersal capacity has long been an active field of research across ecosystems. In marine systems, pelagic larval duration (PLD) has been one of the most widely used indicators of interspecific dispersal potential. The validity of this proxy, however, relies mostly on the assumption of entirely passive dispersal, a notion that has been challenged by findings of strong larval behavioural capabilities. Here, we assessed the effect of larval swimming capacities measured as mean critical swimming speed (U-crit) on emergent species-level properties related to dispersal potential, population genetic structure and global range size, in demersal marine fishes. In a meta-analytic framework, we tested the relative importance of U-crit versus other intrinsic (PLD, egg type, adult body size) and extrinsic (genetic marker type, study scale) predictors of isolation-by-distance slope, global FST and range size. U-crit showed stronger relationships with all emergent response variables than PLD and was consistently the most important predictor in multi-model inference. Our findings indicate that larval swimming capacities could serve as a powerful indicator of a species' long-distance dispersal potential.},

In response, ecological indicators have been developed to assess the state of reef fisheries and their broader ecosystem-level impacts. To date, use of fisheries indicators for coral reefs has been rather piecemeal, with no overarching understanding of their performance with respect to highlighting fishing effects. Here, we provide a review of multispecies fishery-independent indicators used to evaluate fishing impacts on coral reefs. We investigate the consistency with which indicators highlight fishing effects on coral reefs. We then address questions of statistical power and uncertainty, type of fishing gradient, scale of analysis, the influence of other variables and the need for more work to set reference points for empirical, fisheries-independent indicators on coral reefs. Our review provides knowledge that will help underpin the assessment of the ecological effects of fishing, offering essential support for the development and implementation of coral reef fisheries management plans.},

An alternative to the VMS is represented by the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which in the EU became compulsory in May 2014 for all fishing vessels of length above 15 meters. The aim of this paper is to assess the uptake of the AIS in the EU fishing fleet and the feasibility of producing a map of fishing effort with high spatial and temporal resolution at European scale. After analysing a large AIS dataset for the period January-August 2014 and covering most of the EU waters, we show that AIS was adopted by around 75\% of EU fishing vessels above 15 meters of length. Using the Swedish fleet as a case study, we developed a method to identify fishing activity based on the analysis of individual vessels' speed profiles and produce a high resolution map of fishing effort based on AIS data. The method was validated using detailed logbook data and proved to be sufficiently accurate and computationally efficient to identify fishing grounds and effort in the case of trawlers, which represent the largest portion of the EU fishing fleet above 15 meters of length. Issues still to be addressed before extending the exercise to the entire EU fleet are the assessment of coverage levels of the AIS data for all EU waters and the identification of fishing activity in the case of vessels other than trawlers.},

Given the multiple purposes of many protected areas, measuring effectiveness is difficult. Our review of 49 tropical protected areas shows that parks are generally effective at curtailing deforestation within their boundaries. But deforestation in surrounding areas is isolating protected areas. Many initiatives now aim to link protected areas to local socioeconomic development. Some of these initiatives have been successful, but in general expectations need to be tempered regarding the capacity of protected areas to alleviate poverty. Greater attention must also be paid to the broader policy context of biodiversity loss, poverty, and unsustainable land use in developing countries.},

  abstract = {Recovery of overexploited marine populations has been slow, and most remain below target biomass levels. A key question is whether this is due to insufficient reductions in harvest rates or the erosion of population resilience. Using a global meta-analysis of overfished stocks, we find that resilience of those stocks subjected to moderate levels of overfishing is enhanced, not compromised, offering the possibility of swift recovery. However, prolonged intense overexploitation, especially for collapsed stocks, not only delays rebuilding but also substantially increases the uncertainty in recovery times, despite predictable influences of fishing and life history. Timely and decisive reductions in harvest rates could mitigate this uncertainty. Instead, current harvest and low biomass levels render recovery improbable for the majority of the world's depleted stocks.
History Matters
Fishery-induced mortality is not the sole driver of fish population dynamics, and shifts in population abundance are also subject to ecological impacts. In a meta-analysis, Neubauer et al. (p. 347) showed how some fish-stock recoveries have been slower than theoretically predicted. They discovered that a species' exploitation history is also an important predictor of recovery. The data indicate that even extreme limitations in harvest pressure may not allow for the timely recovery of collapsed stocks.},

  abstract = {Fisheries management is most effective when based on scientific estimates of sustainable fishing rates. While some simple approaches allow estimation of harvest limits, more data-intensive stock assessments are generally required to evaluate the stock's biomass and fishing rates relative to sustainable levels. Here we evaluate how stock characteristics relate to the rate of new assessments in the United States. Using a statistical model based on time-to-event analysis and 569 coastal marine fish and invertebrate stocks landed in commercial fisheries, we quantify the impact of region, habitat, life-history, and economic factors on the annual probability of being assessed. Although the majority of landings come from assessed stocks in all regions, less than half of the regionally-landed species currently have been assessed. As expected, our time-to-event model identified landed tonnage and ex-vessel price as the dominant factors determining increased rates of new assessments. However, we also found that after controlling for landings and price, there has been a consistent bias towards assessing larger-bodied species. A number of vulnerable groups such as rockfishes (Scorpaeniformes) and groundsharks (Carcharhiniformes) have a relatively high annual probability of being assessed after controlling for their relatively small tonnage and low price. Due to relatively low landed tonnage and price of species that are currently unassessed, our model suggests that the number of assessed stocks will increase more slowly in future decades.},

  abstract = {The age of scarlet seaperch, Lutjanus malabaricus, from deep waters (\&gt;100 m depth) on the continental shelf of north-western Australia was estimated by examining transverse sections of their sagittal otoliths. Ages were assigned based on counts of alternating opaque and translucent zones (annuli). The consistency of the readings showed that the otolith increments can be used for age determination. Otolith weight was strongly correlated with fish age providing confirmation that the opaque and translucent zones used to estimate age in this study are formed on an annual basis. Growth was found to be moderately slow. The maximum observed age for a male was 31 years corresponding to 802 mm FL. There was significant differential growth between the sexes in observed length-at-age, with males growing larger than females. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were: L{$\infty$}=686.4 mm FL, K=0.180 yr-1, t0=-0.33 for males, and L{$\infty$}=565.8 mm FL, K=0.262 yr-1, t0=-0.09 for females. The annual instantaneous rate of natural mortality (M) was estimated to be 0.112. The life history characteristics of L. malabaricus indicate that this species has a low-production potential and hence is vulnerable to overfishing. Harvest strategies should, therefore, be conservative and fishery managers need to consider harvest refugia in those fisheries where size at first capture cannot be manipulated by modifications to fishing gear, such as the demersal fish trawl and fish trap fisheries of Western Australia.},

  abstract = {This paper examines how the requirement for annual catch limits (ACLs) has been implemented for data-limited stocks in all federally-managed fisheries in the United States. The legal mandate to establish ACLs in the U.S. has spurred substantial scientific advances, including the development and adoption of at least 16 methods for establishing catch limits for data-limited fisheries. This study analyzed the assessment methods that form the basis of ACLs, those which determine the overfishing limits (OFLs) and the acceptable biological catches (ABCs). Nationally, 30\% (150) of OFLs/ABCs are currently calculated using conventional data-rich assessment methods, 11\% (59) using data-moderate methods, and 59\% (295) using data-poor approaches. There is substantial variation in the proportion of stocks that are currently managed with data-rich versus data-limited methods across regions, and there are clear geographical patterns in the types and diversity of methods being utilized to calculate OFLs/ABCs. Data-poor methods are the most commonly used OFL/ABC-setting methods in the U.S., particularly in the Southeast, Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS), Pacific, and Western Pacific regions. The Southeast and Atlantic HMS regions use some form of catch scalar or an ABC of zero landings for each data-limited stock. The Pacific and North Pacific regions currently employ a higher diversity of data-limited methods than any other region; these include both data-moderate methods and data-poor methods. Regional disparities in data-limited method development and implementation are attributed to regional differences in the number of stocks being managed, the data types and lengths of the time series available, and the resources dedicated to data processing and stock assessment. Recommendations for improving management of data-limited stocks include establishing a complete inventory of all available data for each managed stock, dedicating resources and expertise to data-limited method development and evaluation, and developing a more streamlined assessment process to handle the expanded volume of stocks requiring ACLs.},

  abstract = {Community metrics describe aspects of community structure and are often calculated from species-size-abundance data collected during fish stock monitoring surveys. Several community metrics have been proposed as indicators to support ecosystem-based fishery management. These metrics should be sensitive to fishing impacts and respond rapidly to management action, so that managers can assess whether changes in the fish community are a desirable or undesirable response to management. It should also be possible to estimate metrics with sufficient precision so that changes in the community can be detected on management time scales of a year to a few years. Here, we test the power of a large-scale annual trawl survey (North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey, IBTS) to detect trends in six community metrics: mean length, mean weight, mean maximum length, mean maximum weight, slope of the biomass size spectrum, and mean trophic level. Our analyses show that the power of the trawl survey to detect trends is generally poor. While community metrics do provide good long-term indicators of changes in fish community structure, they are unlikely to provide an appropriate tool to support short-term management decisions. If fish community metrics are to provide effective support for ecosystem-based management, and management time scales cannot be extended, then the power of many surveys to detect trends in fish community structure will need to be improved by increased replication and standardization.},

  abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are being implemented worldwide, yet there are few cases where managers make specific predictions of the response of previously harvested populations to MPA implementation. Such predictions are needed to evaluate whether MPAs are working as expected, and if not, why. This evaluation is necessary to perform adaptive management, identifying whether and when adjustments to management might be necessary to achieve MPA goals. Using monitoring data and population models, we quantified expected responses of targeted species to MPA implementation and compared them to monitoring data. The model required two factors to explain observed responses in MPAs: (a) pre-MPA harvest rates, which can vary at local spatial scales, and (b) recruitment variability before and after MPA establishment. Low recruitment years before MPA establishment in our study system drove deviations from expected equilibrium population size distributions and introduced an additional time lag to response detectability. Synthesis and applications. We combined monitoring data and population models to show how (a) harvest rates prior to Marine Protected Area (MPA) implementation, (b) variability in recruitment, and (c) initial population size structure determine whether a response to MPA establishment is detectable. Pre-MPA harvest rates across MPAs plays a large role in MPA response detectability, demonstrating the importance of measuring this poorly known parameter. While an intuitive expectation is for response detectability to depend on recruitment variability and stochasticity in population trajectories after MPA establishment, we address the overlooked role of recruitment variability before MPA establishment, which alters the size structure at the time of MPA establishment. These factors provide MPA practitioners with reasons whether or not MPAs may lead to responses of targeted species. Our overall approach provides a framework for a critical step of adaptive management.},

  abstract = {Time-varying selectivity is one of the main challenges in single species age-based assessment models. In classical deterministic VPA-type models the fishing mortality rates are unfiltered representations of the observed catches. As a consequence the selectivity becomes time-varying, but this representation is too fluctuating, because it includes the observation noise. In parametric statistical catch at age models a common assumption is that the selectivity is constant in all years, although time-varying selectivity can be introduced by splitting the data period in blocks with different selectivities, or by using smoothing splines and penalized time-deviances. However, these methods require subjective choices w.r.t. the degree of time-varying allowed. A simple state-space assessment model is presented as an alternative, which among other benefits offers an objective way of estimating time-varying selectivity pattern. The fishing mortality rates are considered (possibly correlated) stochastic processes, and the corresponding process variances are estimated within the model. The model is applied to North Sea cod and it is verified from simulations that time-varying selectivity can be estimated.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems evolve under many interconnected and area-specific pressures. To fulfil society's intensifying and diversifying needs while ensuring ecologically sustainable development, more effective marine spatial planning and broader-scope management of marine resources is necessary. Integrated ecological\textendash{}economic fisheries models (IEEFMs) of marine systems are needed to evaluate impacts and sustainability of potential management actions and understand, and anticipate ecological, economic and social dynamics at a range of scales from local to national and regional. To make these models most effective, it is important to determine how model characteristics and methods of communicating results influence the model implementation, the nature of the advice that can be provided and the impact on decisions taken by managers. This article presents a global review and comparative evaluation of 35 IEEFMs applied to marine fisheries and marine ecosystem resources to identify the characteristics that determine their usefulness, effectiveness and implementation. The focus is on fully integrated models that allow for feedbacks between ecological and human processes although not all the models reviewed achieve that. Modellers must invest more time to make models user friendly and to participate in management fora where models and model results can be explained and discussed. Such involvement is beneficial to all parties, leading to improvement of mo-dels and more effective implementation of advice, but demands substantial resources which must be built into the governance process. It takes time to develop effective processes for using IEEFMs requiring a long-term commitment to integrating multidisciplinary modelling advice into management decision-making.},

  abstract = {We present a framework for results-based management (RBM) of commercial fisheries. The core idea of RBM is to reduce micromanagement by delegating management responsibility to resource users. The RBM framework represents an industrial organization approach to co-management and comprises three defining processes, conducted by three independent ``agents'': (i) an ``authority'' defines specific and measurable and achievable objectives (outcome targets, OTs) for the utilization of fisheries resources, (ii) resource user organizations (termed ``operators'') take responsibility for achieving these OTs and provide documentation that (iii) allows independent ``auditors'' to evaluate the achievement of OTs. Using incentive mechanisms, notably deregulation, RBM grants operators the flexibility to develop and implement innovative and cost-effective ways to achieve OTs. The feasibility of implementing RBM in five European fisheries was investigated in cooperation with relevant stakeholders through artificial planning processes and computer simulations. The operators involved were enthusiastic, and new management plans were drafted based on the framework. These included socioeconomic OTs in addition to traditional stock objectives, encompassing an ecosystem approach. Several issues are in need of further research to consolidate the approach and prepare the ground for practical implementation, including: the specification of the legal and regulatory framework required to underpin RBM, details of transitional arrangements when shifting towards RBM (including cost-sharing) and the development of necessary organizational capacity for operators. Initially, we therefore envisage the framework being applied to high-value single-species fisheries, with a limited number of participants, which are adequately represented by a competent organization.},

  abstract = {Temperature controls the rate of fundamental biochemical processes and thereby regulates organismal attributes including development rate and survival. The increase in metabolic rate with temperature explains substantial among-species variation in life-history traits, population dynamics, and ecosystem processes. Temperature can also cause variability in metabolic rate within species. Here, we compare the effect of temperature on a key component of marine life cycles among a geographically and taxonomically diverse group of marine fish and invertebrates. Although innumerable lab studies document the negative effect of temperature on larval development time, little is known about the generality versus taxon-dependence of this relationship. We present a unified, parameterized model for the temperature dependence of larval development in marine animals. Because the duration of the larval period is known to influence larval dispersal distance and survival, changes in ocean temperature could have a direct and predictable influence on population connectivity, community structure, and regional-to-global scale patterns of biodiversity.},

Simulation of artificial data with (i) growth parameters that differed from the estimation model, (ii) transient size structures, and (iii) recruitment variability led to predictably biased estimates.

While persistence of marine populations requires maintenance of a sufficient level of lifetime reproduction, fishing reduces lifetime reproduction by increasing the total mortality rate, preventing individuals from growing old, large, and highly fecund. We employ a new method of estimating changes in lifetime egg production (LEP) using two samples of the size structure, one in the past and one current, to assess persistence of five species of nearshore rockfish (Sebastes spp.) in California and Oregon, USA. Using length frequency data from catch in the recreational fishery, we estimate that since 1980, four of the five rockfish species considered have experienced declines in LEP to levels that suggest that persistence is impaired. When changes in LEP were estimated for subsets of the data corresponding to neighboring geographical regions, differences in LEP levels were apparent in the neighboring regions, implying that the effects of fishing mortality are not evenly distributed over space. We conclude by discussing the use of this estimation approach to assess the status of other species in data-poor situations.},

  abstract = {Species distribution data provide the foundation for a wide range of ecological research studies and conservation management decisions. Two major efforts to provide marine species distributions at a global scale are the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which provides expert-generated range maps that outline the complete extent of a species' distribution; and AquaMaps, which provides model-generated species distribution maps that predict areas occupied by the species. Together these databases represent 24,586 species (93.1\% within AquaMaps, 16.4\% within IUCN), with only 2,330 shared species. Differences in intent and methodology can result in very different predictions of species distributions, which bear important implications for scientists and decision makers who rely upon these datasets when conducting research or informing conservation policy and management actions. Comparing distributions for the small subset of species with maps in both datasets, we found that AquaMaps and IUCN range maps show strong agreement for many well-studied species, but our analysis highlights several key examples in which introduced errors drive differences in predicted species ranges. In particular, we find that IUCN maps greatly overpredict coral presence into unsuitably deep waters, and we show that some AquaMaps computer-generated default maps (only 5.7\% of which have been reviewed by experts) can produce odd discontinuities at the extremes of a species' predicted range. We illustrate the scientific and management implications of these tradeoffs by repeating a global analysis of gaps in coverage of marine protected areas, and find significantly different results depending on how the two datasets are used. By highlighting tradeoffs between the two datasets, we hope to encourage increased collaboration between taxa experts and large scale species distribution modeling efforts to further improve these foundational datasets, helping to better inform science and policy recommendations around understanding, managing, and protecting marine biodiversity.},

Fisheries governance and regulations can alter socio-ecological resilience to climate change impacts via harvest control rules and incentives driving fisher behavior, yet there are no syntheses or conceptual frameworks for examining how institutions and their regulatory approaches can alter fisheries resilience to climate change. We identify nine key climate resilience criteria for fisheries socio-ecological systems (SES), defining resilience as the ability of the coupled system of interacting social and ecological components (i.e., the SES) to absorb change while avoiding transformation into a different undesirable state. We then evaluate the capacity of four fisheries regulatory systems that vary in their degree of property rights, including open access, limited entry, and two types of rights-based management, to increase or inhibit resilience. Our exploratory assessment of evidence in the literature suggests that these regulatory regimes vary widely in their ability to promote resilient fisheries, with rights-based approaches appearing to offer more resilience benefits in many cases, but detailed characteristics of the regulatory instruments are fundamental.},

The study introduces a framework for a realistic multispecies fishery MSE by accounting for fleet dynamics, multispecies fishery quota allocation, and the temporal dynamics of technical interactions. The quota allocation and the fleet dynamics models were implemented using linear programming, and regression approaches were used to realistically project future users' behavioral response to changes in the fishery. Models were calibrated and then validated using historical and out-of-sample data, respectively. The results highlight the importance of accounting for technical interactions and their inter-annual dynamics for both quota allocation and fleet dynamics to design a realistic multispecies fishery MSE (without them, the amount of lost yield increased). Particular attention should therefore be paid to understanding human behavior as well as its uncertainty and to refining approaches to incorporate this information into a multispecies fishery management strategy analysis.},

Here we use 13 models of the ocean\textendash{}carbon cycle to assess calcium carbonate saturation under the IS92a 'business-as-usual' scenario for future emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In our projections, Southern Ocean surface waters will begin to become undersaturated with respect to aragonite, a metastable form of calcium carbonate, by the year 2050. By 2100, this undersaturation could extend throughout the entire Southern Ocean and into the subarctic Pacific Ocean. When live pteropods were exposed to our predicted level of undersaturation during a two-day shipboard experiment, their aragonite shells showed notable dissolution. Our findings indicate that conditions detrimental to high-latitude ecosystems could develop within decades, not centuries as suggested previously.},

  abstract = {Alternative error distributions were evaluated for calculating indices of relative abundance for non-target species using catch and effort data from commercial fisheries. A general procedure is presented for testing the underlying assumptions of different error distributions. Catch rates, from an observer program, of billfish caught mainly as bycatch in a pelagic tuna longline fishery in the Western Central Atlantic were standardized. Although catches of billfishes are not common in pelagic tuna longline fisheries, these fisheries are one of the main sources of fishing mortality for these stocks in the central Atlantic due to the magnitude and spatial extent of longline fishing effort. Billfish CPUE data are highly skewed with a large proportion of zero observations. Delta distribution models can accommodate this type of data, and involve modeling the probability of a non-zero observation and the catch rate given that the catch is non-zero separately. Three different Delta models were compared against other error distributions, including the lognormal, log-gamma, and Poisson. Diagnostic checks and deviance table analyses were performed to identify the best error distribution and the set of factors and interactions that most adequately explained the observed variability. The results indicated that the Delta-lognormal model (a binomial error distribution for the probability of a non-zero catch and lognormal error for the positive catch rates) complied best with the underlying characteristics of the data set. Analyses of catch rates for blue marlin, white marlin and sailfish confirmed the spatio-temporal nature of their distribution in the central Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. Also, the analyses indicated that catch rates of billfish differed among fishing vessel types; larger vessels had a higher probability of catching blue marlin, the more oceanic-oriented species, and lower probabilities of catching the more coastal-oriented species white marlin and sailfish. Standardized catch rates indicated in general a lower relative abundance for blue and white marlin in the most recent years, although estimated confidence intervals overlap through the years especially for white marlin.},

Most studies combined multiple treatments, and this confounding precluded definitive conclusions about which individual treatments are most effective. Treatments that included cognitive dissonance, goal setting, social modeling, and prompts provided the overall largest effect sizes (Hedge's g {$>$} 0.60). Further analyses indicated that different treatments have been more effective for certain behaviors. Although average effect sizes are based on small numbers of studies, effective combinations of treatments and behaviors are making it easy to recycle, setting goals for conserving gasoline, and modeling home energy conservation. The results also reveal several gaps in the literature that should guide further research, including both treatments and PEB that have not been tested.},

However, currently 95\% of assessed stocks are overexploited and 73\% of demersal species are not assessed. To explore the risk of overexploitation to un-assessed stocks, vulnerability scores were constructed using Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) for 151 Mediterranean demersal fish species. Out of 151 species, 58 displayed low vulnerability, 20 medium vulnerability, 25 high vulnerability and 48 were considered of major concern. More than half of stocks showed a risk of being overfished (termed ``vulnerability''), greater than that of the stocks currently assessed in the Mediterranean Sea. Most of the cartilagineous fish fell into the high and major concern areas. The quality of data used for the PSA was scored and these scores could be used to improve future collection of data. Vulnerability scores are well correlated with IUCN red list classification. To rank the priority of commercial stocks still to be assessed, vulnerability scores were scaled with landings and mean price per stock. Eight of the top fifteen ranking stocks are currently not assessed. When the vulnerability of cartilaginous fish was tested against rate of decline estimated from trawl survey time-series, no strong correlation was found. The exploitation ratio (F/Fmsy) of assessed stocks was regressed, using generalized mixed models, against PSA scores and area and a significant relationship was found. Using this result, assessed stocks were used as a training set to predict the exploitation of un-assessed stocks. F/Fmsy was predicted for 151 species in 14 management areas (GSAs). The results over all areas is that 39 species-area combinations are exploited sustainably, all occurring in area 20 (Greece), while the remaining 2075 are exploited unsustainably with respect to Fmsy (F/Fmsy \&gt; 1). This prediction model, albeit after further refinement with more data and testing, could be used to predict exploitation ratio when no information on stock status is available. We predict that {$\approx$}98\% of the unassessed demersal fish species are potentially overexploited in the evaluated areas. This makes it clear that strong management action will be required to achieve the targets of the Common Fisheries Policy in the next 1\textendash{}5 years.},

The governance of natural resources used by many individuals in common is an issue of increasing concern to policy analysts. Both state control and privatization of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. After critiquing the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr. Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions. She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways--both successful and unsuccessful--of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organizations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

Olson's theoretical predictions related to the incapacity of individuals, except under limited conditions, to solve on their own what are now known as `collective action problems'. Olson argued that one characteristic of goods - that of exclusion - defined all public goods. In contemporary analysis, the problem of achieving exclusion of noncontributors has come instead to characterize all types of collective action problems. Multiple subtypes of collective action problems have been identified. One major class of collective action problems are referred to in contemporary literature as public goods. Another class are referred to as common-pool resources. Common-pool resources are characterized by difficulty of exclusion and subtractability of resource units and are threatened by overuse leading to congestion or even destruction of the resource. Such threats do not apply to public goods. Diverse production and allocation functions generate further important differences in behavior and outcomes. Scholars have also begun to recognize multiple types of property right bundles that distinguish among authorized entrants, users and claimants, proprietors and full owners. Empirical studies show that groups of individuals who possess at least the rights of proprietorship are able to govern and manage their systems more effectively than presumed in the earlier theoretical literature. The article ends with an analysis of the factors that may be conducive to the organization of a common-property regime as contrasted to a private-property regime.},

Nearly four years (October 1997\textendash{}June 2001) of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor local area coverage imagery, in situ measurements, and supporting data are analyzed. Monthly mean annual cycles of SST, chlorophyll (Chl) and the water-leaving radiance at 555 nm (LwN(555)), an index for sediment-affected waters, show plumes associated with runoff in winter, while blooms occur in the late spring\textendash{}early summer and are associated with cool SST and upwelling favorable winds. Interannual variations are consistent with remote forcing by El Ni{\~n}o cycles. During the 1997\textendash{}1998 El Ni{\~n}o, Chl concentrations are moderate, and El Ni{\~n}o-induced floodwater discharges result in high LwN(555) values throughout the SBC. However, a correspondence between El Ni{\~n}o\textendash{}La Ni{\~n}a state and Chl is not found for the SBC due to what appears to be the advection of nutrient-depleted waters from the east. Empirical plume and bloom indices show that plumes occur episodically in response to discharge events whereas blooms occur more regularly and can cover up to 95\% of the SBC. Empirical orthogonal function analysis is used to spatially and temporally deconvolve processes regulating SST, Chl and LwN(555). The first Chl mode contains 43\% of the temporal variance and is associated with wind-driven upwelling in spring and summer. The first LwN(555) mode contains 51\% of the temporal variance and is associated with episodic terrestrial runoff events in February and March. The second modes for both Chl and LwN(555) represent the transition from runoff-dominated processes in winter to upwelling and bloom-dominated processes in summer.},

To examine the degree to which early stages can remain spatially coherent during dispersal, we measured genetic relatedness within a large pulse of newly recruited splitnose rockfish (Sebastes diploproa), a live-bearing fish whose offspring settle along the US Pacific Northwest coast after spending up to a year in the pelagic environment. A total of 11.6\% of the recruits in a single recruitment pulse were siblings, providing the first evidence for persistent aggregation throughout a long dispersal period. Such protracted aggregation has profound implications for our understanding of larval dispersal, population connectivity, and gene flow within demersal marine populations.},

While individual case studies and economic theory suggest that cooperatives may manage fisheries effectively under some conditions, there is little empirical evidence comparing the actions of cooperative fisheries across a diverse set of environments. This study applies a standardized survey method to collect data from a set of cooperatively managed fisheries from around the globe, documenting their social, economic, and ecological settings as well as the cooperative behaviors in which they engage and the role they play in conservation. The resulting database covers 67 cooperatives from the major oceanic regions of the world, providing a unique overview of the global diversity of fishery cooperatives. It enables empirical analysis of the links between the characteristics and contexts of fisheries, such as the development status of the host nation, fisheries management practices, and species characteristics, and the collective actions taken by fishery cooperatives. The evidence shows that cooperatives form in a variety of development and governance contexts, and in diverse kinds of fisheries. Fishery cooperatives often take actions directed toward coordinating harvest activities, adopting and enforcing restrictions on fishing methods and effort, and taking direct conservation actions such as establishment of private marine protected areas.},

However, many communities lack the resources to implement effective fisheries management. No-take marine reserves are a ubiquitous management intervention that provide conservation benefits and under certain circumstances can provide long-term fishery benefits as a result of larval and adult emigration from reserve boundaries. But, support for marine reserves by fishery participants is often limited due to short-term economic impacts resulting from foregone yields. In this study, we examine the timing and magnitude of economic impacts of marine reserves by utilizing a novel metric that discounts future economic benefits of enhanced productivity resulting from reserve protection. We ask under what circumstances long-term benefits outweigh short-term impacts of marine reserve implementation. We simulate fisheries for six species commonly caught in coastal environments and show that while conservation benefits accrue rapidly, more than a decade is often required to provide net fisheries benefits, even under circumstances favourable for reserves. We explore a suite of strategies for mitigating these short-term economic losses, including flexible reserve designs, loans and enhanced ex-vessel revenues. Results indicate that market-based incentives show promise to offset short-term economic losses. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding and communicating likely outcomes from marine reserve implementation and the need to engage supply chain actors to incentivize marine conservation that minimizes impacts to fishermen.},

In some contexts, TURFs may be preferred over other rights-based approaches, such as individual transferable quotas (ITQs). However, TURFs may not always achieve fishery goals, for example, when competition exists within or among TURFs. Under these circumstances, there may be value in combining TURFs with cooperatives and/or ITQs to achieve benefits that may not be possible using only one management instrument alone. We use a bioeconomic model to explore potential outcomes of combining TURFs with cooperatives and ITQs, and identify conditions under which combining these approaches can help achieve fishery goals. Our results indicate that ITQs among TURFs can result in optimal levels of profit, even in conditions involving source-sink movement dynamics and heterogeneous fishing skill. We also show that institutions that facilitate cooperation within TURFs can provide near-optimal levels of profits, though this ability depends on cooperation being present in all TURFs within the system. Decreasing costs through ITQs or cooperatives can provide an incentive to catch more fish and drive down biomass, though the TURF structure itself prevents overfishing in our modeled system.},

Harmonic analysis of the climatological time series indicates a best fit with annual and semi-annual constituents. The annual amplitude is the dominant signal in SST, corresponding to the basin-wide seasonal cycle of warming and cooling associated with the north-south migration of the intertropical convergence zone. Influx of upwelled water from the Panam{\'a} Bight into the northeastern part of the study area is also consistent with the annual signal. An empirical orthogonal function decomposition identifies two main spatial patterns with amplitude time series representing out-of-phase annual cycles. The dominant mode corresponds to the strengthening of the Equatorial Front and the South Equatorial Current during the second part of the year. This mode explains 92.2\% of the SST variance and 82.9\% of the ocean-color variance. The second mode is consistent with the topographically induced upwelling of the Equatorial Undercurrent on the western side of the archipelago, and with influx of upwelled Panam{\'a} Bight water on the eastern side, both reaching their peak during the first part of the year.

The seasonal evolution of water-column temperature and nitrate (from World Ocean Atlas 1998 climatologies) is consistent with the satellite-derived patterns.

  abstract = {Genetic analyses of marine population structure often find only slight geographic differentiation in species with high dispersal potential. Interpreting the significance of this slight genetic signal has been difficult because even mild genetic structure implies very limited demographic exchange between populations, but slight differentiation could also be due to sampling error. Examination of genetic isolation by distance, in which close populations are more similar than distant ones, has the potential to increase confidence in the significance of slight genetic differentiation. Simulations of one-dimensional stepping stone populations with particular larval dispersal regimes shows that isolation by distance is most obvious when comparing populations separated by 2\textendash{}5 times the mean larval dispersal distance. Available data on fish and invertebrates can be calibrated with this simulation approach and suggest mean dispersal distances of 25\textendash{}150 km. Design of marine reserve systems requires an understanding of larval transport in and out of reserves, whether reserves will be self-seeding, whether they will accumulate recruits from surrounding exploited areas, and whether reserve networks can exchange recruits. Direct measurements of mean larval dispersal are needed to understand connectivity in a reserve system, but such measurements are extremely difficult. Genetic patterns of isolation by distance have the potential to add to direct measurement of larval dispersal distance and can help set the appropriate geographic scales on which marine reserve systems will function well.},

Larval dispersal may be shorter than previously suspected: neighborhood sizes of 10 to 100 km for invertebrates and 50 to 200 km for fish are common in current compilations. How can small reserves protect such species? One conceptual framework is to set reserve size based on adult neighborhood sizes of highly fished species and determine spacing of a reserve network based on larval neighborhoods. The multispecies nature of fisheries demands that network designs accommodate different life histories and take into account the way local human communities use marine resources.},

In marine ecosystems, several common ecological mechanisms link biodiversity to ecosystem functioning and to a complex of essential services. As a result, the effects of preserving diversity can be broadly beneficial to a wide spectrum of important ecosystem processes and services, including fisheries, water quality, recreation, and shoreline protection. A management system that conserves diversity will help to accrue more ``ecoservice capital'' for human use and will maintain a hedge against unanticipated ecosystem changes from natural or anthropogenic causes. Although maintenance of biodiversity cannot be the only goal for ecosystem-based management, it could provide a common currency for evaluating the impacts of different human activities on ecosystem functioning and can act as a critical indicator of ecosystem status.},

  abstract = {Reef corals are highly sensitive to heat, yet populations resistant to climate change have recently been identified. To determine the mechanisms of temperature tolerance, we reciprocally transplanted corals between reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes and tested subsequent physiological and gene expression profiles. Local acclimatization and fixed effects, such as adaptation, contributed about equally to heat tolerance and are reflected in patterns of gene expression. In less than 2 years, acclimatization achieves the same heat tolerance that we would expect from strong natural selection over many generations for these long-lived organisms. Our results show both short-term acclimatory and longer-term adaptive acquisition of climate resistance. Adding these adaptive abilities to ecosystem models is likely to slow predictions of demise for coral reef ecosystems.
Hot and bothered corals can cope
How well can corals adapt to temperature extremes? Better than anticipated, it turns out. Corals from reef pools with wide temperature fluctuations resist stress better than corals from less extreme pools. Nevertheless, corals transplanted into the hotter and more variable conditions soon acquired thermal tolerance. Palumbi et al. (see the Perspective by Eakin) found that the tougher specimens produced more of certain proteins, such as the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, which protected them from the effects of heat. Ramping up heat shock and transport proteins yielded heat tolerance far more rapidly than mutation and adaptation. Hopefully, this ability will allow some mitigation of climate change on coral reefs.

  abstract = {Spatial separation within predator communities can arise via territoriality but also from competitive interactions between and within species. However, linking competitive interactions to predator distribution patterns is difficult and theoretical models predict different habitat selection patterns dependent on habitat quality and how competition manifests itself. While models generally consider competitors to be either equal in ability, or for one phenotype to have a fixed advantage over the other, few studies consider that an animal may only have a competitive advantage in specific habitats. We used {$>$} 10 years of telemetry data, habitat surveys and behavioral experiments, to show spatial partitioning between and within two species of reef shark (grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhinchos and blacktip reef sharks C. melanopterus) at an unfished Pacific atoll. Within a species, sharks remained within small `sub-habitats' with very few movements of individuals between sub-habitats, which previous models have suggested could be caused by intra-specific competition. Blacktip reef sharks were more broadly distributed across habitat types but a greater proportion used lagoon and backreef habitats, while grey reef sharks preferred forereef habitats. Grey reef sharks at a nearby atoll where blacktip reef sharks are absent, were distributed more broadly between habitat types than when both species were present. A series of individual-based models predict that habitat separation would only arise if there are competitive interactions between species that are habitat-specific, with grey reefs having a competitive advantage on the forereefs and blacktips in the lagoons and backreef. We provide compelling evidence that competition drives distribution patterns and spatial separation of a marine predator community, and highlight that competitive advantages may not be constant but rather dependent on habitats.

This is problematic as it effectively assumes all juveniles survive to maturity.

For 94 chondrichthyans, we now estimate that rmax values are on average 10\% lower than previously published. Our updated rmax estimates are lower than previously published for species that mature later relative to maximum age and those with high annual fecundity.

These developments come largely at a cost of high-fossil fuel energy inputs. Rising energy prices, climate change and consumer demand for `green' products have placed energy use and emissions among the sustainability criteria of food production systems. We have compiled all available published and unpublished fuel use data for fisheries targeting all species, employing all gears and fishing in all regions of the world into a Fisheries and Energy Use Database (FEUD). Here, we present results of our analysis of the relative energy performance of fisheries since 1990 and provide an overview of the current state of knowledge on fuel inputs to diverse fishing fleets. The median fuel use intensity of global fishery records since 1990 is 639~litres per tonne. Fuel inputs to fisheries vary by several orders of magnitude, with small pelagic fisheries ranking among the world's most efficient forms of animal protein production and crustaceans ranking among the least efficient. Trends in Europe and Australia since the beginning of the 21st century suggest fuel use efficiency is improving, although this has been countered by a more rapid increase in oil prices. Management decisions, technological improvements and behavioural changes can further reduce fuel consumption in the short term, although the most effective improvement to fisheries energy performance will come as a result of rebuilding stocks where they are depressed and reducing over-capacity.},

In the alternative 'management-procedure approach', quotas are computed from a predetermined feedback control rule, usually a simple algorithm for adjusting catches in response to monitoring indices. Uncertainty and instability of stock assessments complicate the implementation of the conventional approach. For example, estimates of Pacific halibut biomass have changed substantially from year to year, mostly in response to changes in methodology and newly available survey data. Although the changes improved the assessments, the use of an assessment-based approach to set quotas led to unnecessary disruptions in the fishery. Simulations using operating models derived from recent halibut assessments suggest that a management procedure based on a simple delay-difference model could provide stable and adequate yields and perform similarly to two harvesting strategies considered suitable for Pacific halibut (fixed exploitation rate and constant spawning-biomass-per-recruit), implemented assuming no assessment errors. An advantage of such an approach is that once a robust rule is in place, quota setting can be decoupled from assessment, at least until the latter indicates that modifications are needed.},

Representatives on these committees potentially have widely differing objective preferences. Consequently, there exists the potential for management decisions to be affected not only by the type of representation, but by the individuals themselves. In this paper, the robustness of management decision making to both the stakeholder representation and the individual representatives is tested using the case of fisheries management, for which a number of studies have been undertaken in Australia to assess objective preferences within a multi-objective framework. The results suggest that, in most cases, management decisions are robust to membership, but in a small number of instances the actual composition of individuals in a committee may result in different decisions.},

in U.S. federal waters was recently highlighted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, as an important factor to
consider when 1) identifying stocks that should be managed and protected under a fishery management plan; 2) grouping data-poor stocks into relevant management complexes; and
3) developing precautionary harvest control rules. To assist the regional fishery management councils in determining vulnerability, NMFS elected to use a modified version of a productivity and susceptibility analysis (PSA) because it can be based on qualitative data, has a history of use in other fisheries, and is recommended by several organizations as a reasonable approach for evaluating risk. A number of productivity and susceptibility attributes for a stock are used in a PSA and from these attributes, index scores and measures of uncertainty are computed and graphically displayed. To demonstrate the utility of the resulting vulnerability evaluation, we evaluated six U.S. fisheries targeting 162 stocks that exhibited varying degrees of productivity and susceptibility, and for which data quality varied. Overall, the PSA was capable of differentiating the vulnerability of stocks along the gradient of susceptibility and productivity indices, although fixed thresholds separating low-, moderate-, and highly vulnerable species were not observed. The PSA can be used as a flexible tool that can incorporate regional-specific information on fishery and management activity.},

The need for such information has led to several life history databases being developed to support and disseminate this information publicly. However, there has been little independent evaluation of the precision and accuracy of the life history values in these databases. This article summarizes a recent evaluation of FishBase, one of the largest and oldest life history databases, by distinguishing biases among seven life history parameters, two types of information available in FishBase (i.e., Entered vs. Generated data), and two taxa (i.e., Teleost vs. Chondrichthyan). In general, the study shows that certain types of information like data ``entered'' by experts are relatively accurate and precise, while empirically ``generated'' were not. We conclude with some ideas on how American Fisheries Society members can improve upon the data already available within FishBase.},

We quantified the annual migration cycle of juvenile southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii; SBT) and spatiotemporal variability in this cycle, based on a multi-decadal electronic tagging dataset. Behaviour-switching models allowed for the identification of cohesive areas of residency and classified the temporal sequence of movements within a migration cycle from austral summer foraging grounds in the Great Australian Bight (GAB) to winter foraging grounds in the Indian Ocean and Tasman Sea and back to the GAB. Although specific regions within the Indian Ocean were frequented, individuals did not always return to the same area in consecutive years. Outward migrations from the GAB were typically longer than return migrations back to the GAB. The timing of individual arrivals to the GAB, which may be driven by seasonality in prey availability, was more cohesive than the timing of departures from the GAB, which may be subject to the physiological condition of SBT. A valuable fishery for SBT operates in the GAB, as do a number of scientific research programs designed to monitor SBT for management purposes; thus, understanding SBT migration to and from the area is of high importance to a number of stakeholders.},

All slopes are significantly {$\neq$} 0 (for P = 0{$\cdot$}001). The standard deviation of estimates of log M are for 1) 0{$\cdot$}247, and for 2) 0{$\cdot$}245.
The equations provide highly reliable estimates of M for any given fish stock, given the values of W {$\infty$} or L {$\infty$} and K of the von Bertalanffy growth formula, and an estimate of the mean water temperature in which the stock in question lives.
Only two groups have values of M generally differing from those obtained through the proposed equations: the Clupeidae, with generally lower and the polar fishes with generally higher values. Correction factors are given for both groups. Potential applications of the findings to population dynamics are discussed together with some ecological implications.},

This effect, also found to be occurring in inland fisheries, is most pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere.

Generalizations on the structure and functioning of such ecosystems, relevant to the issue of fisheries impacts, have been developed and these have affected the evolution of the Ecopath approach. Thus, the description of the average state of an ecosystem, using Ecopath proper, now serves to parametrize systems of coupled difference and differential equations, which are used to depict changes in biomasses and trophic interactions in time (Ecosim) and space (Ecospace). The outcomes of these simulations can then be used to modify the initial parametrization, and the simulations are rerun until external validation is achieved. This reconceptualization of the Ecopath approach as an iterative process, which helps address issues of structural uncertainty, does not increase its input requirements markedly. Rather, it has become possible, through a Bayesian resampling routine, to explicitly consider the numerical uncertainty associated with these inputs. We present the key features of the reconceptualized approach, and two indices based thereon for quantifying the ecosystem impacts of fisheries. We conclude with a brief discussion of its limitations, both present and intrinsic.},

Its goal was (and still is) to investigate the impact of fisheries on marine ecosystems and to propose policies to mitigate these impacts. Although conceived as a global activity, the project first emphasized the data-rich North Atlantic as a test bed for developing its approaches, which rely on mapping of catch data and indicators of ecosystem health derived from the analysis of long catch time series data. Initial achievements included mapping the decline, throughout the North Atlantic basin, of high-trophic level fishes from 1900 to the present and the presentation of compelling evidence of change in the functioning of the North Atlantic ecosystems, summarized in a 2003 book. The Central and South Atlantic were the next basins to be tackled, with emphasis on the distant-water fleet off West Africa, culminating in a major conference in Dakar, Senegal, in 2002. The project then emphasized the North Pacific, Antarctica, and marine mammals and the multiplicity of tropical Indo-Pacific fisheries before it turned completely global, with all our major analyses and reports (e.g., on the interactions between marine mammals and fisheries, on fuel consumption by fleets, on the catches of small-scale fisheries, on subsidies to fisheries) being based on global studies. Broadly, the work of the project is aimed at a reappraisal of fisheries, from the benign activity that many interested people still perceive them to be, to a realization that they have become the driver for massive loss of biodiversity in the ocean. Moreover, the emphasis on global estimates (rather than local estimates of dubious generality) has allowed the project to contribute to various global initiatives (e.g., developing the Marine Trophic Index for the Convention on Biological Diversity, quantifying marine ecosystem services for the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment), that is, activities that we expect to increase and for which we invite collaboration from academia and environmental nongovernmental organizations.},

By contrasting the official and the `reconstructed' coral reef catches of four small island states (Fiji and Tonga in the Pacific, and Jamaica and St Kitts \& Nevis in the Caribbean), we show, however, that official catch data, as made available to and by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) not only strongly underestimate catches (from 4 to 17 times for 1950\textendash{}2010), but also suggest increasing catch trends in 3 of 4 cases, that is, the very opposite of the trend resulting from the bottom-up catch reconstructions.

Despite being ``near threatened'', current understanding of habitat use and population structure of Carcharhinus galapagensis is limited to specific areas within its distribution. We evaluated population structure and connectivity across the Pacific Ocean using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (\textasciitilde{}7200 SNPs) and mitochondrial control region sequences (945\,bp) for 229 individuals. Neutral SNPs defined at least two genetically discrete geographic groups: an East Tropical Pacific (Mexico, east and west Galapagos Islands), and another central-west Pacific (Lord Howe Island, Middleton Reef, Norfolk Island, Elizabeth Reef, Kermadec, Hawaii and Southern Africa). More fine-grade population structure was suggested using outlier SNPs: west Pacific, Hawaii, Mexico, and Galapagos. Consistently, mtDNA pairwise {$\Phi$}ST defined three regional stocks: east, central and west Pacific. Compared to neutral SNPs (FST\,=\,0.023\textendash{}0.035), mtDNA exhibited more divergence ({$\Phi$}ST\,=\,0.258\textendash{}0.539) and high overall genetic diversity (h\,=\,0.794\,{$\pm$}\,0.014; {$\pi$}\,=\,0.004\,{$\pm$}\,0.000), consistent with the longstanding eastern Pacific barrier between the east and central\textendash{}west Pacific. Hawaiian and Southern African populations group within the west Pacific cluster. Effective population sizes were moderate/high for east/west populations (738 and 3421, respectively). Insights into the biology, connectivity, genetic diversity, and population demographics informs for improved conservation of this species, by delineating three to four conservation units across their Pacific distribution. Implementing such conservation management may be challenging, but is necessary to achieve long-term population resilience at basin and regional scales.},

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in , which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.

  abstract = {Larval dispersal and spatial distribution of reproducing females of Pandalus borealis in the Barents Sea were investigated. The approach was based on particle tracking using flow fields and a biological model incorporating ontogenetic migration and temperature dependent development of the zoea stages. By the use of individual-based particle-tracking models it is possible to assess the life history of individuals, as opposed to an Eulerian model. The years simulated in this study were 1996\textendash{}1998. New data on larval hatching, development and behaviour from laboratory experiments and field studies are presented. Annual shrimp surveys conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture provided abundance estimates of spawning and one year old shrimp. The biological model simulated the larval development of shrimp from hatching to zoea V, and their vertical migratory behaviour. The results indicated large inter-annual variability with respect to dispersion. This is most likely explained by the position of the Polar Front and the inflow of Atlantic water into the Barents Sea. The spatial distribution of modelled settled larvae was in good agreement with the abundance of 1 year old juveniles obtained from trawl surveys. The distance travelled by a shrimp larvae varied between 0 and 330 km and the annual mean distance varied between 74 and 122 km. Female shrimp in the entire Barents Sea contributed to recruitment to the stock, which is considered to be one population. Therefore, the female component of the shrimp stock has to be the target of management throughout the Barents Sea.},

  abstract = {Surplus production modelling has a long history as a method for managing data-limited fish stocks. Recent advancements have cast surplus production models as state-space models that separate random variability of stock dynamics from error in observed indices of biomass. We present a stochastic surplus production model in continuous time (SPiCT), which in addition to stock dynamics also models the dynamics of the fisheries. This enables error in the catch process to be reflected in the uncertainty of estimated model parameters and management quantities. Benefits of the continuous-time state-space model formulation include the ability to provide estimates of exploitable biomass and fishing mortality at any point in time from data sampled at arbitrary and possibly irregular intervals. We show in a simulation that the ability to analyse subannual data can increase the effective sample size and improve estimation of reference points relative to discrete-time analysis of aggregated annual data. Finally, subannual data from five North Sea stocks are analysed with particular focus on using residual analysis to diagnose model insufficiencies and identify necessary model extensions such as robust estimation and incorporation of seasonality. We argue that including all known sources of uncertainty, propagation of that uncertainty to reference points and checking of model assumptions using residuals are critical prerequisites to rigorous fish stock management based on surplus production models.},

We investigated its direct and indirect effects on food web structure and ecosystem properties (e.g. species biomasses and production) in the Porsanger Fjord in the study period 2009-2011 using 5 subarea Ecopath food web models. The 5 baseline models with different red king crab densities were compared and the food web effects of crab removal were explored through simulations in Ecosim. King crabs were important as benthic predators and exerted strong top-down effects on long-living invertebrates such as predatory gastropods, asteroids, detritivorous echinoderms and herbivorous sea urchins. The crab experienced little predation from fish or other predators at higher trophic levels, thus food web effects of the red king crab generally stayed within the benthic compartment. Red king crab removal decreased system omnivory and resulted in higher food web biomass-low turnover systems, with relatively lower production:biomass ratios of benthic invertebrates. Other ecosystem properties (e.g. total production, consumption, ascendancy and overhead) were little affected by crab abundance and suggest stable systems. Effects of crab removal were less significant in baseline models with low initial crab biomass, and high benthic production by detritivores in the inner fjord may buffer future predation in this area. Indirect effects of crab predation included a positive cascade effect on macroalgae due to predation on herbivorous sea urchins and a negative effect on benthic-feeding birds, indicating competition for invertebrate prey.},

  abstract = {Marine reserve theory suggests that where large, productive populations are protected within no-take marine reserves, fished areas outside reserves will benefit through the spillover of larvae produced in the reserves. However, empirical evidence for larval export has been sparse. Here we use a simple idealized coastline model to estimate the expected magnitude and spatial scale of larval export from no-take marine reserves across a range of reserve sizes and larval dispersal scales. Results suggest that, given the magnitude of increased production typically found in marine reserves, benefits from larval export are nearly always large enough to offset increased mortality outside marine reserves due to displaced fishing effort. However, the proportional increase in recruitment at sites outside reserves is typically small, particularly for species with long-distance (on the order of hundreds of kilometers) larval dispersal distances, making it very difficult to detect in field studies. Enhanced recruitment due to export may be detected by sampling several sites at an appropriate range of distances from reserves or at sites downcurrent of reserves in systems with directional dispersal. A review of existing empirical evidence confirms the model's suggestion that detecting export may be difficult without an exceptionally large differential in production, short-distance larval dispersal relative to reserve size, directional dispersal, or a sampling scheme that encompasses a broad range of distances from the reserves.},

Since the total transfer is endogenous, there is a corollary that dirninishing returns apply to the transfer as well, due both to the opposition provoked by the transfer and to the demand this opposition exerts on resources to quiet it. Stigler does not himself formalize this model, and my first task will be to do just this. My simplified formal version of his model produces a result to which Stigler gave only passing recognition, namely that the costs of using the political process limit not only the size of the dominant group but also their gains. This is at one level, a detail, which is the way Stigler treated it, but a detail with some important implications \textendash{} for entry into regulation, and for the price-output structure that emerges from regulation. The main task of the paper is to derive these implications from a generalization of Stigler's model.},

Both methods were improved to reduce the time of sample preparation and to enhance the appearance of the increments. For each individual, two independent readings were done for upper and lower beak sections, as well as for the lateral wall surfaces. Vertical reflected light (epifluorescence) and image analysis system were shown to be useful in the observation and analysis of the sequence of increments. Precision of the ageing, increment counts obtained by both techniques, and increment widths were discussed. Using upper beak RSS led to more precise age estimates, whereas preparing LWS was quicker and simpler, and revealed a higher number of increments. Therefore, our study recommends counting growth increments in LWS of beaks to age adult common octopus.},

For this, a campaign was designed with the aim of collecting a representative sample of waste toys in different schools in a Spanish town. Altogether 1014.25 kg of waste toys were collected, of which 31.83\% corresponded to the electric and electronic fraction, which is the object of study. The collected wastes were divided into subcategories and a representative sample of each was one used to characterise them physically and chemically. Physical characterisation provided information about the materials they were made of, the electrical and electronic parts, fixing and assembly systems, and so forth. The results showed that the weight of a toy is comprised of 72.30\% of plastics, 12.07\% of electrical and electronic components, 4.47\% of metals, and 11.15\% other materials. In general, the most common types of polymers were PS, PP and ABS. Chemical characterisation made it possible to analyse the composition of the plastic components, which is information that is essential to be able to determine the feasibility of recovering the resulting fractions. The results showed that the content of hazardous substances in these plastics is far below the limits stipulated in Directive 2002/95/EC (RoSH Directive). The findings of this study show a need for a specific management system for this fraction of domestic wastes and a wide range of potential reusability of the discarded toys since 65\% of the toys from the collected sample worked in perfect condition. We also found that the end-of-life is one of the aspects that have not been considered during their design as both materials and disassembly sequence do not facilitate the end-of-life of this type of wastes. This information could be used to improve the ecodesign of electrical and electronic equipment toys regarding their end-of-life.},

  abstract = {Understanding the processes that drive kelp forest communities is critical for management and conservation of these productive ecosystems. As a way to advance in this direction, we explored the effects of fishing pressure and upwelling intensity over kelp forest communities along the central coast of Chile. We sampled kelp communities in different upwelling conditions associated with contrasting management regimes, namely Territorial User Rights for Fisheries (TURFs) and open-access (OA) areas. In TURF areas, we found a 2.6-fold increase in reef fish biomass, higher diversity of all fish trophic groups, mainly dominated by benthic carnivore feeders, and a 1.8-fold reduction in the number of kelp grazers. On the other hand, upwelling regimes evidence a 1.6-fold increase in abundance and recruitment of the dominant kelp (Lessonia trabeculata), and also an increase in biomass of planktivorous reef fishes. We found that grazers were capable of reducing kelp condition (measured as canopy foliage index) in OA areas outside the influence of upwelling. Enclosure experiments in the field revealed the effect of grazers on kelps, reducing kelp growth (i.e., blade elongation) and increasing blade tissue loss. Results provide evidence that TURF areas could be important ancillary conservation instruments in kelp forest ecosystems, if key processes of the subtidal community assemblages (e.g., interactions between grazers and reef fish) are maintained. We conclude that human impact interplays with the influence of upwelling in structuring kelp communities.},

  abstract = {A framework is developed for the provision of scientific advice to support the management of new and developing marine invertebrate fisheries. These fisheries often occur on species for which little biological or exploitation information is available. The framework explicitly endorses the precautionary approach to fisheries management and research. Three general management strategies (size/sex limits, regulation by total allowable catch, control of the exploitation rate) and their needs for supporting scientific information are identified. The significance of spatial pattern, and of recognizing the need for different approaches to obtain scientific information and to manage sedentary benthic and mobile pelagic species, is a central theme. Three 'phases' are proposed to obtain the necessary scientific information: (a) Phase 0, 'collecting existing information', consisting of syntheses of available biological and fisheries information on the target (and similar) species, leading to formulation of potential management strategies; (b) Phase 1, 'collecting new information', to obtain the essential information that is lacking or insufficient from the Phase 0 analysis, and to evaluate alternative management strategies and propose regulatory actions; and (c) Phase 2, 'fishing for commerce', to implement the chosen management actions and to monitor fishing operations, so as to increase the information base available to refine the results from previous phases. Phase 1 activities may consist of surveys, site-specific depletion experiments and studies to obtain biological information, and development of experimental management areas to test different exploitation rates. A strategy that includes establishing reserve areas recognises the inherent uncertainties associated with developing fisheries and provides a buffer against mistakes or 'surprises'; it also provides control areas to compare stock productivity in fished and unfished locations. The application of this framework to a developing sea cucumber fishery in British Columbia is presented as an example. Throughout, strong interaction and collaboration among science, management, and stakeholders is crucial to the provision of scientific advice for precautionary management of new invertebrate fisheries.},

Such `trophic cascade regime shifts' have been reported in a few pelagic marine systems\textemdash{}notably the Black Sea, Baltic Sea and eastern Scotian Shelf\textemdash{}raising the question of how common this phenomenon is in the marine environment. We provide a general methodology for distinguishing top-down and bottom-up effects and apply this methodology to time series from these three ecosystems. We found evidence for top-down forcing in the Black Sea due primarily to gelatinous zooplankton. Changes in the Baltic Sea are primarily bottom-up, strongly structured by salinity, but top-down forcing related to changes in cod abundance also shapes the ecosystem. Changes in the eastern Scotian Shelf that were originally attributed to declines in groundfish are better explained by changes in stratification. Our review suggests that trophic cascade regime shifts are rare in open ocean ecosystems and that their likelihood increases as the residence time of water in the system increases. Our work challenges the assumption that negative correlation between consecutive trophic levels implies top-down forcing.},

We estimate global forage fish contributions to marine ecosystems through a synthesis of 72 published Ecopath models from around the world. Three distinct contributions of forage fish were examined: (i) the ecological support service of forage fish to predators in marine ecosystems, (ii) the total catch and value of forage fisheries and (iii) the support service of forage fish to the catch and value of other commercially targeted predators. Forage fish use and value varied and exhibited patterns across latitudes and ecosystem types. Forage fish supported many kinds of predators, including fish, seabirds, marine mammals and squid. Overall, forage fish contribute a total of about \$16.9 billion USD to global fisheries values annually, i.e. 20\% of the global ex-vessel catch values of all marine fisheries combined. While the global catch value of forage fisheries was \$5.6 billion, fisheries supported by forage fish were more than twice as valuable (\$11.3 billion). These estimates provide important information for evaluating the trade-offs of various uses of forage fish across ecosystem types, latitudes and globally. We did not estimate a monetary value for supportive contributions of forage fish to recreational fisheries or to uses unrelated to fisheries, and thus the estimates of economic value reported herein understate the global value of forage fishes.},

Recent literature has highlighted the exceptional importance of forage fish, which include some of the largest fisheries in the world and produce a sizeable share of the global wild marine fish catch (1). Forage species play an essential and valuable supporting role within marine ecosystems by serving as prey for larger species (2, 3). These findings underscore the importance of (i) furthering understanding of the determinants of forage fish collapses, and (ii) of devising exploitation strategies that will maintain their crucial ecological and economic roles. Essington et al. (4) significantly advance understanding on both counts, applying novel methods to uncover fishing's fingerprint in regulating population fluctuations and demonstrating the effectiveness of a simple remedy to prevent collapses.},

Industrialised fisheries have developed during different decades in different regions of the world, and this has almost always been followed by a period of massive stock decline. However, ecosystems were not pristine before the onset of industrial fishing and it is difficult to assess the `virgin' state of a population given that it may have been subject to moderate or even high levels of fishing mortality for many centuries.A wide range of information is available to help define or deduce historic marine population status. These include `traditional' written sources but also less conventional sources such as archaeological remains, genetic analyses or simple anecdotal evidence. Detailed information, collected specifically for the purpose of determining fish stock biomass tends to exist only for recent decades, and most fishery assessments around the world (and thus time-series of biomass estimates), are less than 30 years long. Here we advocate using a wider range of multidisciplinary data sources, although we also recognise that it can be difficult to separate natural variability associated with changing climatic conditions from human-induced changes through fishing. We consider whether or not recovery of degraded ecosystems is ever possible and discuss a series of one-way ratchet like processes that can make it extremely difficult to return to a former ecosystem state.},

Surveys of terrestrial species have suggested that large-bodied species and top predators are the most at risk, and it is commonly assumed that such patterns also apply in the ocean. However, there has been no global test of this hypothesis in the sea. We analyzed two fisheries datasets (stock assessments and landings) to determine the life-history traits of species that have suffered dramatic population collapses. Contrary to expectations, our data suggest that up to twice as many fisheries for small, low trophic-level species have collapsed compared with those for large predators. These patterns contrast with those on land, suggesting fundamental differences in the ways that industrial fisheries and land conversion affect natural communities. Even temporary collapses of small, low trophic-level fishes can have ecosystem-wide impacts by reducing food supply to larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals.},

By examining fisheries in the northeastern United States over the last four decades of warming temperatures, we show that northward shifts in species distributions were matched by corresponding northward shifts in fisheries. The proportion of warm-water species caught in most states also increased through time. Most importantly, however, fisheries shifted only 10\textendash{}30 \% as much as their target species, and evidence suggested that economic and regulatory constraints played important roles in creating these lags. These lags may lead to overfishing and population declines if not accounted for in fisheries management and climate adaptation. In coupled natural-human systems such as fisheries, human actions play important roles in determining the sustainability of the system and, therefore, future conservation and climate mitigation planning will need to consider not only biophysical changes, but also human responses to these changes and the feedbacks that these responses have on ecosystems.},

However, we lack methods for predicting population openness. Here, we develop a model for openness and show that considering habitat isolation explains the existence of surprisingly closed populations in high-dispersal species, including many marine organisms. Relatively closed populations are expected when patch spacing is more than twice the standard deviation of a species' dispersal kernel. In addition, natural scales of habitat patchiness on coral reefs are sufficient to create both largely open and largely closed populations. Contrary to some previous interpretations, largely closed marine populations do not require mean dispersal distances that are unusually short, even for species with relatively long pelagic larval durations. We predict that habitat patchiness has strong control over population openness for many marine and terrestrial species with a highly dispersive life stage and relatively sedentary adults. This information can be used to make initial predictions about where populations will be more or less resilient to local exploitation and disturbance.},

Fish and other animals have already shifted into new territory at a rate averaging 70 km per decade (2), and these shifts are expected to continue or accelerate (3). We show here that many species will likely shift across national and other political boundaries in the coming decades, creating the potential for conflict over newly shared resources.

  abstract = {This paper presents the case for adopting ecosystem rebuilding as the goal of fisheries management. Movement toward this goal may represent the only hope for fisheries, as we know them, to exist 50 years in the future alongside essential services provided by marine ecosystems. First, I review archaeological, historical, and recent evidence that bears witness to a long, dismal record of overexploitation. Second, I examine the ecological effects of overfishing on aquatic ecosystems. Fish with life histories and spatial behavior inimical to harvesting are selectively removed, both within and among species. The loss of keystone species and the replacement of high-value, demersal resources with pelagic, rapid-turnover, low-value species shifts the nature of ecosystems, evidenced by accelerating local extinctions and a worldwide decline in trophic level. Disconcertingly, harvest limits that appear safe by single species evaluation can engender ecosystem changes that are hard to reverse. Driven by a progression of clever human harvest technologies, three ratchet-like processes have brought about episodes of depletion. ``Odum's ratchet'' is ecological in nature, comprising depletion and local extinction. ``Ludwig's ratchet,'' economic in nature, is a positive feedback loop between increased catching power and serial depletion, driven by the need to repay borrowed money. ``Pauly's ratchet'' is cognitive, shifting the baseline of what each generation regards as primal abundance and diversity. Third, a rebuilding policy goal is distinguished from that of sustaining current catches and biomass, since the baseline can refer to present misery. In this sense, present policies can inadvertently foreclose future options for the generation of food, wealth, and services from ocean resources. A policy to rebuild ecosystems can reverse this trend and maximize economic value in tomorrow's markets, where supply will vastly outstrip demand for high-quality fish products. Fourth, I outline a novel methodology, termed ``Back to the Future,'' that can implement a goal of ecosystem rebuilding. Models of past ecosystems are reconstructed using information about the presence and abundance of species from historical documents, archaeology, and local and traditional environmental knowledge (LEK and TEK). Economic evaluation compares past with present and alternative ecosystems. ``Back to the Future'' gives the TEK of aboriginal and indigenous peoples a valuable, direct function in resource management. Finally, I discuss two practical management measures, paralleling recent developments in terrestrial reconstruction ecology, the implementation of large no-take marine reserves, and the reintroduction of high-value species that were formerly endemic.},

  abstract = {rapfish is a new multi-disciplinary rapid appraisal technique for evaluating the comparative sustainability of fisheries. For the purpose of this analysis, fisheries may be defined flexibly as entities with a broad scope, such as all the fisheries in a lake, or with narrower scope, such as those in a single jurisdiction, target species, gear type or vessel. A set of fisheries may be compared, or the time trajectories of individual fisheries may be plotted. Attributes are chosen to reflect sustainability within each discipline, and although intended to remain fixed for all analyses, may be refined or substituted as improved information becomes available. Ordinations of sets of attributes are performed using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) followed by scaling and rotation. Ordinations are anchored by fixed reference points that simulate the best and worst possible fisheries using extremes of the attribute scores, while other anchors secure the ordination in a second axis normal to the first. Randomly scored reference points act as anchors and define significant differences. Separate rapfish ordinations may be performed in ecological, economic, ethical, social and technological disciplines: a further evaluation field expresses compliance with the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to estimate errors, while the leverage of each attribute on scores can be estimated with a stepwise procedure. Status results may be expressed on a scale from 0 to 100\%, and scores from several fields may be combined in kite diagrams to facilitate comparison of fisheries or fisheries constructed to represent alternative policies. Some validations of the methodology are presented, using simulated fishery data. Results from published work using rapfish are reviewed briefly, along with prospects for further improvements to the technique.},

  abstract = {This paper reports recent developments in Rapfish, a normative, scalable and flexible rapid appraisal technique that integrates both ecological and human dimensions to evaluate the status of fisheries in reference to a norm or goal. Appraisal status targets may be sustainability, compliance with a standard (such as the UN code of conduct for responsible fisheries) or the degree of progress in meeting some other goal or target. The method combines semi-quantitative (e.g. ecological) and qualitative (e.g. social) data via multiple evaluation fields, each of which is assessed through scores assigned to six to 12 attributes or indicators: the scoring method allows user flexibility to adopt a wide range of utility relationships. For assessing sustainability, six evaluation fields have been developed: ecological, technological, economic, social, ethical and institutional. Each field can be assessed directly with a set of scored attributes, or several of the fields can be dealt with in greater detail using nested subfields that themselves comprise multidimensional Rapfish assessments (e.g. the hierarchical institutional field encompasses both governance and management, including a detailed analysis of legality). The user has the choice of including all or only some of the available sustainability fields. For the attributes themselves, there will rarely be quantitative data, but scoring allows these items to be estimated. Indeed, within a normative framework, one important advantage with Rapfish is transparency of the rigour, quality and replicability of the scores. The Rapfish technique employs a constrained multidimensional ordination that is scaled to situate data points within evaluation space. Within each evaluation field, results may be presented as a two-dimensional plot or in a one-dimensional rank order. Uncertainty is expressed through the probability distribution of Monte-Carlo simulations that use the c.l. on each original observation. Overall results of the multidisciplinary analysis may be shown using kite diagrams that compare different locations, time periods (including future projections) and management scenarios, which make policy trade-offs explicit. These enhancements are now available in the R programming language and on an open website, where users can run Rapfish analyses by downloading the software or uploading their data to a user interface. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem-orientated thinking is increasingly incorporated into fishery management. Given the complexity of ecosystem processes, there is a need to evaluate the tools used to steer this thinking critically. ECOPATH with ECOSIM (EwE), an aggregate system-modelling package, is currently the most widely employed approach to assess the ecosystem effects of fishing. The basic equations and assumptions, strengths and weaknesses, and the potential of this approach to contribute to practical fisheries management advice are reviewed. Strengths include the structured parameterization framework, the inclusion of a well-balanced level of conceptual realism, a novel representation of predator-prey interaction terms, and the inclusion of a Bayes-like approach (ECORANGER) to take account of the uncertainty associated with values for model inputs. Weaknesses in model structure include the constraining nature of the mass-balance assumption (of ECOPATH) for initiating projections, the questionable handling of life history responses such as compensatory changes in the natural mortality rates of marine mammals, overcompensatory stock-recruit relationships that result from default parameter settings, possible problems in extrapolating from the microscale to the macroscale, as well as some (not too far-reaching) mathematical inconsistencies in the underlying equations. There is a paucity of systematic and stepwise investigations into model behaviour and properties, and users are cautioned against non-critical use of the default settings. An important limitation related to the predominant use of EwE as a "black-box" modelling tool is that some users fail to consider a range of alternative interaction representations. As with all multispecies approaches, the major limitation in applying the EwE approach lies in the quality and quantity of available data. Current EwE applications generally do not adequately address uncertainty in data inputs and model structure. Prudent EwE applications that utilize good data and are based upon rigorous statistical analyses can complement the quantitative predictions of traditional single-species models. They could be particularly useful in some contexts if output in the form of probability distributions encompassing a range of likely ecosystem responses were to be coupled with attempts to extend Operational Management Procedure (OMP) approaches to fisheries management beyond the singlespecies level. In particular, such applications could serve as the operating models of the underlying dynamics that are used for computer simulation testing of OMPs.},

Climate change is likely to have a significant impact on both target and non-target marine stocks worldwide, with the concomitant need for management strategies capable of sustaining fishing in future. We use several southern hemisphere fisheries to highlight the likely impacts of climate change at a range of levels, from individual to population responses, as well as ecosystem ramifications. Examples span polar (Antarctic krill fishery), temperate (west coast pelagic fishery, abalone and rock lobster), and tropical (Torres Strait rock lobster) commercially important fisheries. Responses of these fisheries to either past observed environmental changes or projected future changes are used to deduce some anticipated implications of climate change for fisheries management, including economic impacts and governance considerations. We evaluate the effectiveness of current single-species assessment models, management strategy evaluation approaches and multispecies assessment models as future management tools to cope with likely climate-related changes. Non-spatial stock assessment models will have limited ability to separate fishery effects from the impacts of climate change. Anthropogenic climate change is occurring at a time-scale relevant to current fisheries management strategic planning and testing. Adaptive management frameworks (with their feedback loops) are ideal for detecting and adapting to changes in target stocks.},

The stocks most severely impacted centre on those characterised by high economic value, such as abalone, as well as long lived and slow growing species such as Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides). Effective management of these stocks as well as assessment of the impacts of IUU fishing on the resources is impeded by the technical difficulties associated with determining the magnitude of the IUU catches. The South African abalone Haliotis midae fishery rates as an extreme example of extraordinarily high levels of illegal and unreported (IU) catch. To assess the level and trends in IU catches, we used a combination of approaches that included collation of confiscation records from law enforcement, development of a novel index (the confiscations per unit policing effort\textemdash{}CPUPE), estimation of illegal catches using a spatial and age-structured assessment model, and cross-checking of model outputs through comparison with trade data on abalone imports in destination countries. The model-predicted 2008 IU estimate was 860 tonnes, more than 10 times the total allowable catch (TAC) for that year, and implied that, on average, 14\% of all IU catches are confiscated. Associated management responses included the listing of H. midae on Appendix III of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), and a temporary closure of the commercial fishery. We summarise both technical and management lessons to be learnt from this integrated approach to assess and verify the magnitude of IU fishing.},

Equilibrium assumptions common in many modelling approaches need to be replaced by formulations that allow for changing baselines and integration of ongoing changes and adaptations by species, ecosystems and humans. As ecosystems change, so will the ways humans use, monitor and manage them. Consequently, adaptive management loops and supporting tools deserve more prominence in the management toolbox. Models are critical tools for providing an early understanding of the challenges to be faced by integrating observations and examining possible solutions. We review modelling tools currently available to incorporate the effect of climate change on marine and freshwater ecosystems, and the implications for management of natural resources. System non-linearity can confound interpretations and hence adaptive management responses are needed that are robust to unexpected outcomes. An improvement in the ability to model the effects of climate change from a social and economic perspective is necessary. The outputs from `end-to-end' and socio-ecological models can potentially inform planning, in both Australia and the Pacific region, about how best to build resilience to climate change. In this context, the importance of well directed data-collection programs is also emphasised. Lessons from this region, which is advanced with regard to modelling approaches, can guide increased use of models to test options for managing aquatic resources worldwide.},

A risk management approach is appropriate due to uncertainty in climate projections and the responses of target species. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) can underpin and support effective risk management. Climate change impacts are likely to differ by species and spatially. We use a spatial MSE applied to a multi-species data-poor sea cucumber/b{\'e}che-de-mer fishery to demonstrate the utility of MSE to test the performance of alternative harvest strategies in meeting fishery objectives; this includes the ability to manage through climate variability and change, and meeting management objectives pertaining to resource status and fishery economic performance. The impacts of fishing relative to the impacts of climate change are distinguished by comparing future projection distributions relative to equivalent no-fishing no-climate-change trials. The 8 modelled species exhibit different responses to environmental variability and have different economic value. Status quo management would result in half the species falling below target levels, moderate risks of overall and local depletion, and significant changes in species composition. The three simple strategies with no monitoring (spatial rotation, closed areas, multi-species composition) were all successful in reducing these risks, but with fairly substantial decreases in the average profit. Higher profits (for the same risk levels) could only be achieved with strategies that included monitoring and hence adaptive management. Spatial management approaches based on adaptive feedback performed best overall.},

Quantitative models to support fisheries decision-making may be either strategic (`big picture', direction-setting and contextual) or tactical (focused on management actions on short timescales), with some strategic models informing the development of tactical models. We describe and review `Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessments' (MICE) that have a tactical focus, including use as ecosystem assessment tools. MICE are context- and question-driven and limit complexity by restricting the focus to those components of the ecosystem needed to address the main effects of the management question under consideration. Stakeholder participation and dialogue is an integral part of this process. MICE estimate parameters through fitting to data, use statistical diagnostic tools to evaluate model performance and account for a broad range of uncertainties. These models therefore address many of the impediments to greater use of ecosystem models in strategic and particularly tactical decision-making for marine resource management and conservation. MICE are capable of producing outputs that could be used for tactical decision-making, but our summary of existing models suggests this has not occurred in any meaningful way to date. We use a model of the pelagic ecosystem in the Coral Sea and a linked catchment and ocean model of the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, to illustrate how MICE can be constructed. We summarize the major advantages of the approach, indicate opportunities for the development of further applications and identify the major challenges to broad adoption of the approach.},

  abstract = {Networks of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely advocated for the conservation of marine biodiversity. But for MPA networks to be successful in protecting marine populations, individual MPAs must be self-sustaining or adequately connected to other MPAs via dispersal. For marine species with a dispersive larval stage, populations within MPAs require either the return of settlement-stage larvae to their natal reserve or connectivity among reserves at the spatial scales at which MPA networks are implemented. To date, larvae have not been tracked when dispersing from one MPA to another, and the relative magnitude of local retention and connectivity among MPAs remains unknown. Here we use DNA parentage analysis to provide the first direct estimates of connectivity of a marine fish, the orange clownfish (Amphiprion percula), in a proposed network of marine reserves in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea. Approximately 40\% of A. percula larvae settling into anemones in an island MPA at 2 different times were derived from parents resident in the reserve. We also located juveniles spawned by Kimbe Island residents that had dispersed as far as 35 km to other proposed MPAs, the longest distance that marine larvae have been directly tracked. These dispersers accounted for up to 10\% of the recruitment in the adjacent MPAs. Our findings suggest that MPA networks can function to sustain resident populations both by local replenishment and through larval dispersal from other reserves. More generally, DNA parentage analysis provides a direct method for measuring larval dispersal for other marine organisms.},

Rapid worldwide depletion of predatory fish communities. Nature 2003;423:280\textendash{}3). Their analyses were published in a high profile science journal along with an accompanying press release, which then attracted substantial international media focus and public attention. This media focus in turn has been used as a base for advocating major marine policy changes for pelagic tuna fisheries (e.g. a minimum of a 50\% reduction in catches and establishment of extensive marine reserves). However, among numerous scientific experts involved in tuna and pelagic fishery research substantial concerns exist that Myers and Worm's analyses provide a misleading picture of the status of large predatory pelagic fishes. These concerns are reviewed using data from the Indian Ocean for illustrative purposes and indicate that the initial longline catches were not responsible for a rapid depletion of the main tuna and billfish stocks nor were they threatening the overall sustainability of these stocks. However, the status of a number of theses stocks is of concern as a result of large increases in catches in more recent years. The debate sparked by Myers and Worm's paper should not distract from the critical problem of developing and implementing effective international management policies. In addition to implications for fishery management, the publication, peer-review, scientific response and publicity process associated with the publication of Myers and Worm's paper are discussed. Concerns are raised that if these become standard practices for articles in high profile science journals that this would undermine the trust placed in such journal to provide an accurate and well-balanced representation of the most important new scientific findings and in their role to inform policy decisions based on these findings.},

Size at maturity is labile in these crustaceans, and like juvenile growth and survival rates, is greatly influenced by density-dependent factors. Changes in size at maturity of females (and hence in lifetime egg production per recruit) enables increases or decreases in population egg production to take place, regulating average long-term larval settlement intensity, and increasing or decreasing the degree of density-dependence of juvenile growth and survival rates. The latter determines the annual rate of recruitment to the adult stock, and together with maturity size, determines the annual egg production from the population.
A feed-back process is operative, such that if egg and larval production declines to a large extent (as a result of sustained environmental changes or overfishing), growth and survival rates of juveniles increase, as does mean size at maturity of females. Increased fecundity per recruit then helps to offset the reduced egg production. This process may help explain the remarkable degree of resilience which some lobster populations display in response to high exploitation rates, but also suggests that recruitment overfishing may be currently taking place in several heavily fished lobster stocks.},

While new international policy and assessment processes such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) recognize the importance of an increasingly global, quantitative and comprehensive approach to biodiversity protection, most insights are still focused on a single facet of biodiversity\textemdash{}species. Here we broaden the focus and provide an evaluation of how much of the world's species, functional and phylogenetic diversity of birds and mammals is currently protected and the scope for improvement. We show that the large existing gaps in the coverage for each facet of diversity could be remedied by a slight expansion of protected areas: an additional 5\% of the land has the potential to more than triple the protected range of species or phylogenetic or functional units. Further, the same areas are often priorities for multiple diversity facets and for both taxa. However, we find that the choice of conservation strategy has a fundamental effect on outcomes. It is more difficult (that is, requires more land) to maximize basic representation of the global biodiversity pool than to maximize local diversity. Overall, species and phylogenetic priorities are more similar to each other than they are to functional priorities, and priorities for the different bird biodiversity facets are more similar than those of mammals. Our work shows that large gains in biodiversity protection are possible, while also highlighting the need to explicitly link desired conservation objectives and biodiversity metrics. We provide a framework and quantitative tools to advance these goals for multi-faceted biodiversity conservation.},

  abstract = {Effective management of marine protected areas (MPAs) requires continuous feedback of information to achieve objectives. In 2000, a collaborative initiative was launched to improve the management of MPAs. The initiative focused on working with managers, planners, and other decision-makers to develop a set of indicators for assessing the effectiveness of MPA use. This initiative was aimed at both enhancing the potential and capability for adaptive management of MPAs, as well as improving our understanding of how effective MPAs that are now being used around the world. This paper presents an overview of the MPA management effectiveness methodology and indicators, summary results of the testing phase of the guidebook at 18 MPAs around the world, and considerations for its application and use as an adaptive management tool for MPAs.},

  abstract = {The population abundance estimates used in stock assessments or required to establish management measures, depend on the sampling of the entire demographic spectrum of a population resident in a given area. However, for sea turtles, most population estimates are based mainly on nesting beach survey data and only consider a fraction of the population. The Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWA) is an important foraging and development area for juveniles of the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta where reproductive stocks from various nesting beaches mix. Declines in C. caretta populations have been observed in many parts of the world and bycatch rates of this species in the SWA are among the highest worldwide. This study standardizes the catch rates of loggerheads caught by pelagic longline fisheries in the region, using data collected by observer programs from Brazil and Uruguay. Generalized linear models (GLM) with a delta lognormal approximation were used. The variables used in the model take into account spatial and temporal variations as well as the characteristics of the fleet. In total, 6 272 344 hooks were observed between 1998 and 2007, with minimum effort registered in 2000 (12 010 hooks) and maximum effort in 2005 (1 989 431 hooks). During this period 3778 loggerheads were incidentally captured. The catch rates of loggerheads by the Uruguayan and Brazilian pelagic longline fisheries show oscillations through the years without a clear tendency; however, a low negative trend was observed from 1998 to 2005 with an increase in the last two years (2006 and 2007). The capture per unit of effort (CPUE) values varied between 0.38 to 1.78 ind/1000 hooks in 2005 and 2007, respectively. Distinct zones with differential catch rates were identified, with the higher CPUE values over the continental slope of Uruguay and adjacent waters. The incidental catch rates of this species are influenced, not only by fishing area, but also by year, season, sea surface temperature and gear type. In consequence, these variables and other potential ones should be considered in bycatch estimates by different fisheries because the loggerhead sea turtles are not uniformly distributed. This study intends to contribute not only to the general knowledge of loggerhead sea turtles in the SWA but to a future assessment of their populations at a global scale.},

These stocks vary in status from lightly exploited to rebuilding to severely depleted. Previous studies suggested that this variability could result from differences in life-history characteristics and economic incentives, but differences in exploitation histories and management measures also have a strong effect on current stock status. Although the status (biomass and fishing mortality rate) of major tuna and billfish stocks is well documented, the effect of these diverse factors on current stock status and the effect of management measures in rebuilding stocks have not been analysed at the global level. Here, we show that, particularly for tunas, stocks were more depleted if they had high commercial value, were long-lived species, had small pre-fishing biomass and were subject to intense fishing pressure for a long time. In addition, implementing and enforcing total allowable catches (TACs) had the strongest positive influence on rebuilding overfished tuna and billfish stocks. Other control rules such as minimum size regulations or seasonal closures were also important in reducing fishing pressure, but stocks under TAC implementations showed the fastest increase of biomass. Lessons learned from this study can be applied in managing large industrial fisheries around the world. In particular, tuna regional fisheries management organizations should consider the relative effectiveness of management measures observed in this study for rebuilding depleted large pelagic stocks.},

These organizations have been criticized for not meeting conservation objectives, which may relate to aspects of governance and management. No previous studies have systematically evaluated why management performance differs among tRFMOs and among stocks within each tRFMO. In this study, we collected data on the nature of research, management, enforcement and socioeconomics of management systems in the five principal tRFMOs of the world's oceans. We quantified influences of economic and fishery-related factors on these management characteristics and examined how these factors vary among tRFMOs. We found that tRFMOs with a greater number of member countries, a greater economic dependency on tuna resources, a lower mean per capita gross domestic product, a greater number of fishing vessels and smaller vessels were associated with less intensive research, management and enforcement in these tuna fisheries. We also quantified the influence of specific management attributes and of biological, economic and fishery-related factors on the trends and current status of large pelagic fish stocks in these regions. The most important factors correlated with trends and current stock status were external to the management systems, and included stock size, age at maturity, ex-vessel price and economic dependency of countries on tuna fisheries. To improve the overall status of large pelagic fish stocks in the global high seas, more intensive data collection, research and management are needed in certain areas, especially in the Indian Ocean, and for certain stocks, especially non-target species.},

Individual quotas, fishing effort allocation, and over-quota discarding in mixed fisheries. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 323\textendash{}333. Many fisheries are managed by total allowable catches (TACs) and a substantial part by individual quotas. Such output management has not been successful in mixed fisheries when fishers continue to fish while discarding marketable fish. We analyse the effects of individual quotas on spatial and temporal effort allocation and over-quota discarding in a multispecies fishery. Using a spatially explicit dynamic-state variable model, the optimal fishing strategy of fishers constrained by annual individual quotas, facing uncertainty in catch rates, is studied. Individual fishers will move away from areas with high catches of the restricted quota species and, depending on the cost of fishing, will stop fishing in certain periods of the year. Individual vessels will discard marketable fish, but only after their individual quota for the species under consideration has been reached. These results are in line with observations on effort allocation and discarding of marketable fish, both over-quota discarding and highgrading, by the Dutch beam-trawl fleet. The models we present can be used to predict the outcomes of management and are therefore a useful tool for fisheries scientists and managers.},

In order to address bias produced by body wall elasticity, we compared the performance of four measurements and one compound index that combines different biometric parameters: the square root of the length-width product (SLW). Results showed that variability in length data due to body wall elasticity was controlled by using body length (Le) from the SLW compound index. Growth in I. badionotus follows a negative allometric tendency. Slow or zero growth periods were observed during October and November, when weather conditions were adverse.},

  abstract = {Many modern stock assessment methods provide the machinery for determining the status of a stock in relation to certain reference points and for estimating how quickly a stock can be rebuilt. However, these methods typically require catch data, which are not always available. We introduce a model-based framework for estimating reference points, stock status, and recovery times in situations where catch data and other measures of absolute abundance are unavailable. The specif ic estimator developed is essentially an age-structured production model recast in terms relative to pre-exploitation levels. A Bayesian estimation scheme is adopted to allow the incorporation of pertinent auxiliary information such as might be obtained from meta-analyses of similar stocks or anecdotal observations. The approach is applied to the population of goliath grouper (Epinephelus itajara) off southern Florida, for which there are three indices of relative abundance but no reliable catch data. The results confirm anecdotal accounts of a marked decline in abundance during the 1980s followed by a substantial increase after the harvest of goliath grouper was banned in 1990. The ban appears to have reduced fishing pressure to between 10\% and 50\% of the levels observed during the 1980s. Nevertheless, the predicted fishing mortality rate under the ban appears to remain substantial, perhaps owing to illegal harvest and depth-related release mortality. As a result, the base model predicts that there is less than a 40\% chance that the spawning biomass will recover to a level that would produce a 50\% spawning potential ratio.},

Despite considerable progress in identifying factors that affect the prospects for collective action, no consensus exists about the role played by heterogeneity and size of group. The debate continues in part because of a lack of uniform conceptualization of these factors, the existence of non-linear relationships, and the mediating role played by institutions. This article draws on research by scholars in the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) research network which demonstrates that some forms of heterogeneity do not negatively affect some forms of collective action. More importantly, IFRI research draws out the interrelations among group size, heterogeneity, and institutions. Institutions can affect the level of heterogeneity or compensate for it. Group size appears to have a non-linear relationship to at least some forms of collective action. Moreover, group size may be as much an indicator of institutional success as a precondition for such success.},

In multivariate relationships, natural variability in one variable can induce statistical significance in collinear variables even if they bear no structural relationship.

New and innovative approaches are needed to stop the ongoing decline of data-poor fisheries and loss of coastal biodiversity they are driving. In recent decades, marine protected areas have become the most preferred form of management for study and have been widely implemented as broadly applicable powerful management tools for data-poor fisheries, but although clearly capable of building biomass within sanctuaries, their effectiveness for sustaining fisheries is proving more difficult to substantiate. This study suggests the new approach needed is actually a return to the established basics of managing size selectivity. Previous studies have established the wisdom of managing size selectivity and fishing pressure to catch fish above the size or age of maturity, but their prescriptions are difficult to implement without age studies, or the capacity for controlling catches and fishing pressure. This study develops an easily implementable rule of thumb based simply on multiples of size of maturity and quantifies its benefit where controlling fishing pressure is not yet possible. Our study provides a timely reminder that even if used alone, size selectivity, the oldest form of management, still produces pretty good sustainable yields. We suggest our rule of thumb can be used to prevent data-poor fisheries declining while capacity for more complex forms of assessment and management are developed.},

  abstract = {The spatial distribution of resources and the behavior of a species lead to a spatial pattern of density which has been called the concentration profile of the species. Some species aggregate and may be found almost entirely at high densities, other species space themselves much more uniformly and are usually found at low densities, and some species are found at a very wide range of densities. The interaction between the concentration profile, fishing, and management behavior leads to a number of surprising consequences. Fishermen will naturally tend to fish in the most profitable places, so that the interaction between the concentration profile of the species and the behavior of the fishermen will lead to a complex spatial pattern in abundance, profitability, and catch per unit effort (CPUE). Among the behaviors that emerge from such analysis are (i) overall CPUE will frequently decline more rapidly than abundance, (ii) CPUE will provide almost no information about abundance that can be used for management except on the smallest of spatial scales, and (iii) changes in price or costs of fishing may have significant impacts on the spatial pattern of fishing effort and the associated CPUE. We illustrate these principles in detail with examples from the Tasmanian abalone fishery on a small scale (tens of metres) and a large scale (hundreds of kilometres). Recognition of the concentration profile of the stock suggests that regulatory measures must be carefully tuned to the biology of the species. CPUE will almost certainly be a very poor measure of stock abundance, while fishery-independent surveys will provide the only reliable method of estimating stock status. Complex spatial structure, with differences in growth and mortality will mean that size limits and harvest rates should be finely tuned to the spatial structure of the stock and cannot be set appropriately over large areas. We consider alternative regulatory schemes such as quotas, seasons, size limits, and territorial fishing rights allocations in relation to concentration profiles and suggest that territorial fishing rights offer the greatest potential benefits.},

An empirical harvest strategy for an Australian longline fishery was developed and tested using harvest strategy evaluation. The approach is based on catch rate and size composition indices and iteratively drives the population towards a target level of spawning potential ratio. The simulation model assumed traditional age-structured population dynamics. The results demonstrate that the empirical approach represents a promising feedback strategy that becomes more precautionary as data errors and recruitment variance increase. Given the urgent need for formal harvest strategies to replace ad hoc decision-making in data-poor fisheries, the approach offers considerable promise. Independent implementation at local scales across the range of a species is speculated to result in management that is robust to uncertainty about stock structure.},

New and innovative approaches are needed to stop the ongoing decline of data-poor fisheries and loss of coastal biodiversity they are driving. In recent decades, marine protected areas have become the most preferred form of management for study and have been widely implemented as broadly applicable powerful management tools for data-poor fisheries, but although clearly capable of building biomass within sanctuaries, their effectiveness for sustaining fisheries is proving more difficult to substantiate. This study suggests the new approach needed is actually a return to the established basics of managing size selectivity. Previous studies have established the wisdom of managing size selectivity and fishing pressure to catch fish above the size or age of maturity, but their prescriptions are difficult to implement without age studies, or the capacity for controlling catches and fishing pressure. This study develops an easily implementable rule of thumb based simply on multiples of size of maturity and quantifies its benefit where controlling fishing pressure is not yet possible. Our study provides a timely reminder that even if used alone, size selectivity, the oldest form of management, still produces pretty good sustainable yields. We suggest our rule of thumb can be used to prevent data-poor fisheries declining while capacity for more complex forms of assessment and management are developed.},

The equilibrium version of the model can be used to estimate a number of bioeconomic reference points, such as the fishing effort for the maximum sustainable yield per recruit, or the maximum economic yield per recruit. The stochastic and dynamic version can be used to assess every year the risk of exceeding common benchmarks used in fishery management, taking into account uncertainty in parameters, such as catchability and recruitment. It was found that the recruitment has decreased since 1988 and that the effort should be limited at the level of maximum economic yield.},

The rationale is that increased accessibility of the best available evidence will provide a more efficient and less biased platform for decision making. We argue that there are significant benefits for conservation in using such a framework, but the scientific community needs to undertake and disseminate more systematic reviews before the full benefit can be realized. We devised a set of guidelines for undertaking formalized systematic review, based on a health services model. The guideline stages include planning and conducting a review, including protocol formation, search strategy, data inclusion, data extraction, and analysis. Review dissemination is addressed in terms of current developments and future plans for a Web-based open-access library. By the use of case studies we highlight critical modifications to guidelines for protocol formulation, data-quality assessment, data extraction, and data synthesis for conservation and environmental management. Ecological data presented significant but soluble challenges for the systematic review process, particularly in terms of the quantity, accessibility, and diverse quality of available data. In the field of conservation and environmental management there needs to be further engagement of scientists and practitioners to develop and take ownership of an evidence-based framework.},

  abstract = {Stock assessments based on the integrated paradigm often include an underlying stock-recruitment relationship. This, along with estimates of fishery selectivity and biological parameters, allows the biomass and fishing mortality associated with Maximum Sustainable Yield (BMSY and FMSY respectively) to be calculated. However, the estimates of these quantities may differ from the proxies assumed in the harvest control rules that are used to provide management advice. Moreover, the estimated values for BMSY and FMSY are related functionally in population dynamics models based on 2-parameter stock-recruitment relationships such as the commonly used Beverton-Holt or Ricker relationships. Use of 2-parameter stock-recruitment relationships (SRRs) consequently restricts the ability to fully quantify the uncertainty associated with estimating BMSY and FMSY because 2-parameter SRRs restrict the potential range of values for BMSY/B0. In principle, BMSY/B0 and FMSY can be more independent if the stock-recruitment relationship is more general than these 2-parameter SRRs. This paper outlines eleven potential 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationships and evaluates them in terms of whether they are able to match a wide range of specifications for BMSY (expressed relative to unfished spawning stock biomass, B0) and FMSY (expressed relative to natural mortality, M). Of the eleven 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationships considered, the Ricker-Power stock-recruitment relationship is found to best satisfy the characteristics of (a) being able to mimic a wide range of BMSY/B0 and FMSY/M values, (b) not to lead to negative recruitment for biomasses between 0 and B0, and (c) not to lead to increasing recruitment while approaching the limit of zero population size. Bayesian assessments of three example groundfish species off the US west coast (aurora rockfish, petrale sole, and cabezon) are conducted using Simple Stock Synthesis based on the Beverton-Holt and Ricker-Power stock-recruitment relationships to illustrate some of the impacts of allowing for a 3-parameter stock-recruitment relationship.},

The details of such an approach are developed. The approach involves deterministic forward projection of the biomass trajectory implied by each assessment for a period (e.g. 10 years) under the TACs or target levels of effort indicated by that and the other assessments. Within the framework developed, it is possible to allow for the effects of "learning" (i.e. updating parameter estimates as more data become available). The approach is relatively simple computationally and allows for quick and sometimes revealing comparisons between assessment/management procedures to be made. It is applied to the variety of assessments available for the stock of Cape hake off northern Namibia. The implication of the analyses conducted is that application of the f 0.1 harvesting strategy in combination with either the Spanish assessment procedure and the ICSEAF "revised" data set, or the South African assessment procedure using the Spanish OTB-8 data series, could lead to rapid resource depletion, so that use of these procedures would seem to be inappropriate for this stock.},

This paper applies that approach to examine the effects of possible culls of Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus on catches and catch rates of the bottom-trawl fishery for the Cape hakes off the South African west coast. The approach involves constructing a ?minimal realistic model? of the hake-seal system. The model considered here includes the two species of Cape hake, Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, the Cape fur seal and an ?other predatory fish? component. Values for parameters of the model are derived from biological studies and by fitting to abundance indices for the hake and seal populations. The model is able to mimic the catch rate information for hake satisfactorily for a range of scenarios for the carrying capacity of the seal population, although the trend in hake abundance indicated since seal harvests commenced some four centuries ago until the start of the hake fishery in 1917 is, of course, questionable. The impact of the seal culls examined on the hake fishery is minimal (and can even be detrimental) for the base-case model, which takes account of both hake species and assumes that seals do not prey on the deep-water hake species M. paradoxus. This result is insensitive to changes to the values of most of those parameters of the model that are not well known. However, increasing the extent of predation by seals on M. paradoxus leads to greater projected benefits for the hake fishery under a future seal cull. It seems likely that a change in the future pattern of fishing to reflect a greater relative fishing intensity uponM. capensis would have a similar result. The conclusions of the paper will not necessarily apply to other southern African regions where the M. paradoxus : M. capensis is much lower than on the South African west coast.},

These  matrices are estimated from tag\&\#8211;recapture data within a  maximum-likelihood estimation framework.

Various alternative  models are contrasted for one site in the south-east of Tasmania, and a best  model is selected by the likelihood ratio test.

Growth rates  differ markedly among regions around Tasmania, being slowest in the south and  fastest in the north. Growth of legal-size males is noticeably faster than  that of legal-size females. It is shown that ignoring the effects of  selectivity can lead to biased estimates of growth rate.

This has necessitated the development of a stock assessment model that can be used to evaluate the relative merits of a variety of alternative catch limits in terms of the trade-off between protecting the rock lobster resource and achieving a high yield. Each of eight regions around Tasmania is assessed separately because of spatial heterogeneity between regions in lobster growth, size at maturity and catch rates.

Given the uncertainty about the appropriate error-model to assume when fitting generalized linear models to catch and effort data, four alternative error-models \textemdash{} log-normal, log-gamma, Poisson, and negative binomial \textemdash{} were explored when modelling the non-zero catch rates.},

  abstract = {Calls to use target, limit and threshold reference points to achieve precautionary management goals have increased substantially in recent years. For many fisheries there is little chance of conducting formal stock assessments, and indicators of stock status have to be based on changes in measurable quantities such as catch rates and percentiles of the length distribution of the catch. Use of such empirical indicators for management decisions also requires a choice of appropriate reference or trigger levels for the indicators. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to examine the performance of alternative indicators and associated reference points in terms of their ability to correctly identify the biological conditions that they were designed to measure. This study examines the performance of several potential empirical indicators for broadbill swordfish off eastern Australia, taking into account uncertainties in stock structure, current status, and future trends in fishing effort. Indicators based on catch rates are shown to be potentially very misleading. In contrast, indicators based on the mean length or mean weight of the catch perform better, because these quantities change in a more predictable manner with abundance. Nevertheless, reference points based on these quantities are frequently \&\#8216;triggered\&\#8217; either too early or too late.},

The simulations consider the impact of measurement error and process error in catchability and the length at 50\% selectivity, as well as the implications of pooling data across populations that differ in terms of growth rate. The ability to estimate the virgin biomass depends critically on having catch-rate or size-composition data for earliest years of exploitation; in the absence of such data the estimates can be highly biased and imprecise. Several of the reference points commonly reported for assessment purposes (e.g. the biomass at which maximum sustainable yield is achieved) are, however, based on the estimate of the virgin biomass. Estimation performance (bias and precision of estimated quantities) deteriorates with increasing process error. For most of the scenarios examined, the expected benefits of increased precision arising from pooling data across spatial zones are not realized and better performance can be achieved by conducting assessments at the level of population and subsequently aggregating results spatially.},

For fisheries managed using Total Allowable Catches, such as Australia's Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), discarding of target species can occur for reasons related to the size of the fish caught, markets, and the amount of quota held by individual quota holders. This paper illustrates how the assessments for two of the species in the SESSF, blue grenadier, Macruronus novaezelandiae, and the western stock of blue warehou, Seriolella brama, are conducted to take account of discards. Discards of blue grenadier are predominantly small fish so the assessment distinguishes between retained and discarded fish, and includes likelihood components related to the weight of the discards and the age-structure of the discards. In contrast, discards of blue warehou are due primarily to quota-related issues, so the assessment adds the discards to the catches and the catch-rate indices, and fits to total catches and catch-rates. Model outputs suggest that strong year-classes can be detected before they enter the fishery by including data on discards in assessments while ignoring such data when conducting assessments can lead to biased assessment outcomes. Several caveats related to the use of data on discards in stock assessments are outlined.},

The results indicate that there is a considerable between-model variation in key model outputs such as the catch predicted for 2010 and the estimated future long-term catches corresponding to maximum economic yield. This variation is comparable with that due to uncertainty about economic parameters when all species are modelled using a size-structured population dynamics model, highlighting the importance of both good population dynamics models and accurate economic parameter inputs. The results also highlight some of the implications (in terms of estimating effort and catch levels which maximize NPV) of not having sufficient data when using population dynamics models to explicitly represent some of the species caught in a multi-species fishery.},

The results suggest that, unlike stock status relative to the unfished level and Maximum Sustainable Yield, estimates of EMSY and BMSY are generally poor, with poor performance attributed mainly to production models ignoring transient age and size dynamics, and the impact of data contrast as well as the extent of process and observation error.},

VPA tends to make only weak assumptions regarding (age-specific) selectivity (asymptotic selectivity and temporal stability of selectivity for the most recent years). In contrast, selectivity is more parametric in ``integrated'' methods, and can be age-, length-, and age- and length-based. The use of parametric selectivity functions tends to reduce estimation variation because fewer parameters have to be estimated, but incorrect choices for the functional form for selectivity can lead to bias. This paper illustrates effects of poor choices for selectivity on the outcomes of stock assessments, outlines methods for evaluating whether a particular choice for selectivity is appropriate using residual diagnostics, and summarizes current ways to select among alternative functional forms for selectivity. This paper also provides a synthesis of the results of past simulation studies which have explored the ability to correctly parameterize selectivity.},

The technical aspects of MSE, including how to design operating models that represent the managed system and how to simulate future use of management strategies, are well understood and can be readily applied, especially for single-species fisheries. However, MSE evaluations seldom identify strategies that will satisfy all the objectives of decision-makers simultaneously, i.e. each strategy will achieve a different trade-off among the objectives. This study illustrates the basis for identifying management objectives and representing them mathematically using performance measures, as well as how trade-offs among management objectives have been displayed to various audiences who provide input into decision-making. Approaches and experiences are illustrated using case studies. Examples highlight the wide variety of objectives that can be considered using MSE, but that traditional single-species considerations continue to dominate the information provided to decision-makers. The desirability and consequences of having minimum acceptable standards of performance for management strategies, as well as difficulties assigning plausibility ranks to alternative states of nature, are found to be among the major challenges to effective provision of strategic advice on trade-offs among management strategies.},

  abstract = {Most fisheries stock assessment methods are based on the assumption that fish are homogeneously distributed across the area being assessed or that fish movement is such that local fishing pressure does not lead to heterogeneous spatial patterns of abundance. However, this assumption is seldom valid in practice. Seven alternative approaches for conducting assessments when confronted with possible spatial variation in fishing mortality, growth and recruitment are identified. These approaches range from ignoring spatial structure, to conducting a multi-area assessment that accounts for spatial variation in biological and fishery processes. These seven approaches are tested using simulations in which there is a single population with spatial heterogeneity, and the only linkage among areas is larval movement. The simulations are based on fishery and biological characteristics for pink ling, Genypterus blacodes, off southeast Australia. Non-spatial assessment configurations that aggregate spatially-structured data provide more precise, but nevertheless biased estimates of initial and final spawning biomass, as well as biased estimates of the ratio between initial and final spawning biomass. Assessment configurations that allow for spatial structure can provide imprecise and highly biased estimates, although these can be improved by changing the relative weighting applied to different data types. A spatially-structured assessment configuration that correctly matches the structure of the model used to generate the simulated data sets is unbiased but imprecise. When confronted with possible spatial heterogeneity in biological and fishery parameters, we propose conducting sensitivity analyses based on several model configurations to select the appropriate structure for an assessment. The capacity to examine model residuals spatially remains valuable for inferring problems with model specification.},

  abstract = {An ecosystem approach to forage fish management is required because forage fish support large fisheries, are prey for many valued species in marine food webs, and provide important social and cultural benefits to humans. Complex ecosystem models are often used to evaluate potential ecosystem consequences of forage fish fisheries, but there is seldom sufficient data to parameterize them, and full consideration of uncertainty is impossible. Models of Intermediate Complexity for Ecosystem assessment (MICE) provide a link between full ecosystem models and tactical (usually single-species) models typically used in fisheries management. MICE are ideal tools to form the basis for management strategy evaluations that compare the ability of candidate strategies to achieve goals related to target fisheries and broader ecosystem protection objectives. A MICE model is developed for the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) that focuses on the fishery for the northern subpopulation of Pacific sardine (Sardinops sajax) and the indirect impacts of the fishery on place-based predators, in particular brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) and California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), in the Southern California Bight. The model includes three forage species (sardine, northern anchovy Engraulis mordax, and `other forage'), an `other prey' category, and two predator species (brown pelican and California sea lion) and evaluates the impacts of variable forage availability on adult predator reproductive success and survival. Parameterization of the model is based on available monitoring data and assessment outputs. The model is used to assess the ecosystem and fishery consequences of the current sardine management systems for Mexico, the USA, and Canada, with a focus on identifying which among a long list of sources of uncertainty in the system are most consequential for predictions of fishery impacts on predators. Key sources of uncertainty to consider in ecosystem assessments for the CCE are how prey abundance and availability impact predator demography and the extent to which the dynamics of prey populations are driven by environmental factors. Data are available for some of these sources of uncertainty for CCE sardine management, but much uncertainty remains, necessitating exploration of sensitivity to alternative model formulations and parameter values when providing advice on management strategies to decision makers.},

The ability of MSE to facilitate fisheries management achieving its aims depends on how well uncertainty is represented, and how effectively the results of simulations are summarized and presented to the decision-makers. Key challenges for effective use of MSE therefore include characterizing objectives and uncertainty, assigning plausibility ranks to the trials considered, and working with decision-makers to interpret and implement the results of the MSE.

  abstract = {The results of fishery stock assessments based on the integrated analysis paradigm can be sensitive to the values for the factors used to weight each of the data types included in the objective function minimized to obtain the estimates of the parameters of the model. These assessments generally include relative abundance index data, length-composition information and conditional age-at-length data, and algorithms have been developed to select weighting factors for each of these data types. This paper introduces methods for weighting conditional age-at-length data that extend an approach developed by Francis (2011) to weight age- and length-composition data. Simulation based on single-zone and two-zone operating models are used to compare five tuning methods that are constructed as combinations of methods to weight each data type. The single-zone operating models allow evaluation of the tuning methods in terms of their ability to provide unbiased estimates of management-related quantities and the correct data weights in the absence of model mis-specification, while the two-zone operating models allow the impacts of model mis-specification on the performance of tuning methods to be explored. The results of assessments are sensitive to data weighting, but the choice of method for data weighting is most consequential when there is model mis-specification. Overall, the results indicate that arithmetic averaging of effective sampling sample sizes from the McAllister and Ianelli (1997) approach is inferior to other methods, and the new method for computing effective sample sizes for conditional age-at-length data seems most appropriate.},

The evaluated methods estimate historical and future biomass for a situation that roughly mimics Pacific herring Clupea pallasii at Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada. The baseline operating model theorizes ten areas arranged such that there is post-recruitment dispersal among all areas. Simulated data (catches, catch age-composition, estimates of spawning stock biomass and its associated age structure) generated for each area are analyzed using estimation methods that range in complexity from ignoring spatial structure to explicitly modelling ten areas. Estimation methods that matched the operating model in terms of spatial structure performed best for hindcast performance and short-term forecasting, i.e., adding spatial structure to assessments improved estimation performance. Even with similar time trajectories among sub-stocks, accounting for spatial structure when conducting the assessment leads to improved estimates of spawning stock biomass. In contrast, assuming spatial variation in productivity when conducting assessments did not appreciably improve estimation performance, even when productivity actually varied spatially. Estimates of forecast biomass and of spawning stock biomass relative to the unfished level were poorer than estimates of biomass for years with data, i.e., hindcasts. Overall, the results of this study further support efforts to base stock assessments for small pelagic fishes on spatially-structured population dynamics models when there is a reasonable likelihood of identifying the sub-stocks that should form the basis for the assessment.},

Although spatially variable, our results indicate intense fishing pressure based on high trip frequencies and fishing effort. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) differed significantly among countries and locations, and fishers on some islands caught high numbers of low-value species. Young fishers went fishing more often, but age did not affect fishing effort and CPUE. Fishers collected a wide range of sea cucumbers, and up to 27 species were harvested in Fiji. Species composition in catches differed significantly among countries and between genders; women usually harvest species typical of shallower reef habitats. Fishers tended to view stocks as declining or greatly over-exploited. Based on fisher knowledge, recent catch rates for an average fishing day have declined by 33\textendash{}92\% across the study countries compared to 10+ years in the past. Our study shows that fishing modes, catch rates and catch composition in small-scale fisheries can be highly context-dependent. Management measures and interventions to support fisher livelihoods must consider gender differences and location-specific fishing activities. Sharp declines in catch rates over time in all countries, fisher perceptions of resource trajectories, and a predominance of low-value species in present-day harvests, provide strong evidence of widespread over-exploitation.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the governance of the Sanya Coral Reef National Marine Nature Reserve (SCR-NMNR) in China in the context of a rapidly growing local economy, driven mainly by recent growth in the tourism sector. The governance approach adopted in the SCR-NMNR is characterised by significant decentralisation, i.e. many roles have been devolved to the local government. However, this has led to the undermining of strategic conservation objectives by local economic development priorities, through the rapid development of mass tourism involving both the private sector and the local government. This reliance on economic incentives has provided alternative livelihoods and resources for the management of the MPA, but has also incurred environmental and social costs. Overall, it can be argued that the current governance approach cannot effectively address the full spectrum of challenges encountered, in that these costs appear to outweigh the benefits. In order to improve the governance of the SCR-NMNR towards more effective and equitable outcomes, strengthened leadership from the central state will be needed, as well as a sense of community stewardship towards the MPA.},

We address the question what will be the status of these wild stocks in the midterm future, in the year 2048, to be specific. Whereas the effects of climate change and ecological driving forces on fish stocks have already gained much attention, our prime interest is in studying the effects of changing economic drivers, as well as the impact of variable management effectiveness. Using a process-based ecological\textendash{}economic multispecies optimization model, we assess the future stock status under different scenarios of change. We simulate (i) technological progress in fishing, (ii) increasing demand for fish, and (iii) increasing supply of farmed fish, as well as the interplay of these driving forces under different scenarios of (limited) fishery management effectiveness. We find that economic change has a substantial effect on fish populations. Increasing aquaculture production can dampen the fishing pressure on wild stocks, but this effect is likely to be overwhelmed by increasing demand and technological progress, both increasing fishing pressure. The only solution to avoid collapse of the majority of stocks is institutional change to improve management effectiveness significantly above the current state. We conclude that full recognition of economic drivers of change will be needed to successfully develop an integrated ecosystem management and to sustain the wild fish stocks until 2048 and beyond.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT.  I trace the development of fisheries models (i.e., fish population dynamics models of species subject to fisheries) to the 21st century. The first real efforts occurred in the period 1900 1920 with the work of Baranov (the ``Grandfather'' of fisheries population dynamics) and the formation of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The establishment of the science occurred between 1920 1960 with multi-species modeling, age- and size-structure dynamics, and production models. Fundamental work during this time was done by Ricker (the ``Father'' of fisheries population dynamics), Beverton and Holt (the ``Prophets'' of fisheries population dynamics), Chapman, Dickie, DeLury, Graham, Gulland, Leslie, Lotka and Volterra, Russell, Schaefer, and Thompson. During this time, most of the workwas deterministic and mathematical. Between 1960 and 1980, statistical methodology evolved greatly but was separate from mathematical advances for the most part. The development of statistical principles for the estimation of animal abundance was further enhanced by Arnason, Buckland, Burnham and Anderson and White, Cormack, Eberhardt, Jolly, Manly, Pollock, Ricker, Robson, and Seber, among others. Fisheries models evolved in a deterministic setting, with advances in age-structured models (Gulland, Pope, Doubleday), surplus production models (Pella, Tomlin-son, Schnute, Fletcher, Hilborn), growth models, bioeconomic models (C. Clark) and management control models (Hilborn, Walters). The period 1980 2000 was the Golden Age. The integration between mathematics and statistics occurred when likelihood and least squares techniques were formally combined with mathematical models of population change. The number of fisheries modelers grew exponentially during this time, resulting in a concomitant increase in publications. A major advance in the 1990s has been the development of Bayesian and time series methods, which have allowed explicit specification of uncertainty. Currently, theory allows realistic modeling of age- and size-structured populations, migratory populations and harvesting strategies. These models routinely incorporate measurement error, process error (stochasticity) and time variation. But data needs often overwhelm the performance of models, and greater demands are being placed on models to answer complex questions. There has been poor communication between fisheries and ecological modelers, between fisheries researchers and statisticians, and among fisheries researchers in different geographic locales. Future models will need to deal better with habitat and spatial concerns, genetics, multispecies interactions, environmental factors, effects of harvesting on the ecosystem, model misspecification and so-cioeconomic concerns. Meta-analysis, retrospective analysis and operating models are some modern approaches for dealing with uncertainty and providing for sustainable fisheries. However, I fear that current attacks on single-species models and management may result in rejection of these advances and an attempt to substitute a less scientific approach.},

The development of the fishery is described in a historical context, including the evolution of South Africa's science-based abalone fishery management system. The diverse suite of responses deployed to combat illegal fishing and the black market trade in abalone are reviewed, including;- fishery reform to expand rights to a greater number of previously disadvantaged fishers, a territorial user rights fishery (TURF) system, special compliance operations and courts, the CITES listing of abalone, and the serial reduction in the TAC, culminating in the controversial and legally contested closure of the fishery. The main causes of the rise of the illegal fishery are diagnosed as 1) the massive increase in the abalone price that occurred in the 1990s triggering an abalone fishing ``gold-rush'' and 2) the failure of the post-Apartheid fishery reform process to accommodate many traditional fishers in a legal fishing rights framework resulting in them operating outside the formal fishery management system. By contextualising the abalone fishery as a complex system, embedded in South Africa's socio-political setting, we show how the resource focussed fishery management system did not have the capacity to incorporate the powerful social, political and economic drivers determining fisher behaviour. We conclude with the need to revisit South Africa's abalone fishery management paradigm, and argue that a more integrated governance approach is required that takes into account the biological, socio-political and economic factors determining the fishery activities.},

Efforts to mitigate these challenges have led to an extensive literature on fishery performance under alternative management practices, but relatively little evidence exists on the factors that drive the adoption of these management approaches. In this study, a database describing 67 fishery cooperatives around the world is analyzed to help fill this gap. The analysis is focused on two widely implemented catch share management strategies, Territorial Use Rights Fisheries and Individual Quotas. Our empirical approach and interpretation of results are organized according to Ostrom's social-ecological systems framework. Among the evaluated factors, governance aspects appear to be most important to management adoption, specifically the presence of legal conditions on cooperative existence, and the strength of law and stability of governing institutions. It is postulated that the same factors that favor adoption of specific catch share management strategies would also generally play a positive role in their performance. If this is true, our results highlight the importance of considering both sets of factors when trying to spread the implementation of management tools, and show that enabling conditions associated to existing governance structures deserve great emphasis by those who seek to adopt management strategies like catch shares.},

A number of scientific hypotheses have been put forward to explain the hiatus, including both physical climate processes and data artifacts. However, despite the intense focus on the hiatus in both the scientific and public arenas, rigorous statistical assessment of the uniqueness of the recent temperature time-series within the context of the long-term record has been limited. We apply a rigorous, comprehensive statistical analysis of global temperature data that goes beyond simple linear models to account for temporal dependence and selection effects. We use this framework to test whether the recent period has demonstrated i) a hiatus in the trend in global temperatures, ii) a temperature trend that is statistically distinct from trends prior to the hiatus period, iii) a ``stalling'' of the global mean temperature, and iv) a change in the distribution of the year-to-year temperature increases. We find compelling evidence that recent claims of a ``hiatus'' in global warming lack sound scientific basis. Our analysis reveals that there is no hiatus in the increase in the global mean temperature, no statistically significant difference in trends, no stalling of the global mean temperature, and no change in year-to-year temperature increases.},

Multiple sources of error are readily identifiable, including estimation error, model specification error, forecast error, and errors associated with the definition and estimation of reference points. Our focus here, however, is to quantify the influence of estimation error and model specification error on assessment outcomes. These are fundamental sources of uncertainty in developing scientific advice concerning appropriate catch levels and although a study of these two factors may not be inclusive, it is feasible with available information. For data-rich stock assessments conducted on the U.S. west coast we report approximate coefficients of variation in terminal biomass estimates from assessments based on inversion of the assessment of the model's Hessian matrix (i.e., the asymptotic standard error). To summarize variation "among" stock assessments, as a proxy for model specification error, we characterize variation among multiple historical assessments of the same stock. Results indicate that for 17 ground-fish and coastal pelagic species, the mean coefficient of variation of terminal biomass is 18\%. In contrast, the coefficient of variation ascribable to model specification error (i.e., pooled among-assessment variation) is 37\%. We show that if a precautionary probability of overfishing equal to 0.40 is adopted by managers, and only model specification error is considered, a 9\% reduction in the overfishing catch level is indicated.},

Countries manage their fisheries as if they were a local resource. To some degree, this may reflect reality, but marine fish, perhaps more than any other vertebrate group, are connected across large distances through ocean currents. Ramesh et al. model how these currents distribute the fish larvae of more than 700 species. They used network analysis to assess the degree to which populations found in one part of the world may have come from another. It seems that global fish populations represent a small-world network where connections across populations are tight and particular hubs of productivity are widely important. Such connectivity has wide-ranging implications for conservation, management, and food supplies globally.
Science, this issue p. 1192
Fish stocks are managed within national boundaries and by regional organizations, but the interdependence of stocks between these jurisdictions, especially as a result of larval dispersal, remains poorly explored. We examined the international connectivity of 747 commercially fished taxonomic groups by building a global network of fish larval dispersal. We found that the world's fisheries are highly interconnected, forming a small-world network, emphasizing the need for international cooperation. We quantify each country's dependence on its neighbors in terms of landed value, food security, and jobs. We estimate that more than \$10 billion in annual catch from 2005 to 2014 is attributable to these international flows of larvae. The economic risks associated with these dependencies is greatest in the tropics.
Marine fish populations are globally connected such that international fisheries depend on international flows of fish larvae.

Beyond the overall policy framework, this paper explores the implementation of the multiannual multispecies management plans as one of the real moves towards Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management. This is carried out on the basis of two case studies that address the design of multiannual multispecies management plans for the Baltic Sea and for the Atlantic Pelagic fisheries. The analyses strengthen with empirical evidences our understanding of the challenges ahead including, among others, an institutional gap between fisheries and environmental policy frameworks resulting in a limited integration of broader environmental concerns in one of the proposed plan and the standoff between decision-makers that delays the adoption and use of proposed management plans and creates frustration for the involved agencies.},

Considerable research has focused on the ability of MPAs to increase fishery returns, but the potential for the broader class of spatial management approaches to outperform MPAs has received far less attention. We use bioeconomic models of seven nearshore fisheries in Southern California to explore the value of optimized spatial management in which the distribution of fishing is chosen to maximize profits. We show that fully optimized spatial management can substantially increase fishery profits relative to optimal nonspatial management but that the magnitude of this increase depends on characteristics of the fishing fleet and target species. Strategically placed MPAs can also increase profits substantially compared with nonspatial management, particularly if fishing costs are low, although profit increases available through optimal MPA-based management are roughly half those from fully optimized spatial management. However, if the same total area is protected by randomly placing MPAs, starkly contrasting results emerge: most random MPA designs reduce expected profits. The high value of spatial management estimated here supports continued interest in spatially explicit fisheries regulations but emphasizes that predicted increases in profits can only be achieved if the fishery is well understood and the regulations are strategically designed.},

  abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP), whereby areas of the ocean are zoned for different uses, has great potential to reduce or eliminate conflicts between competing management goals, but only if strategically applied. The recent literature overwhelmingly agrees that including stakeholders in these planning processes is critical to success; but, given the countless alternative ways even simple spatial regulations can be configured, how likely is it that a stakeholder-driven process will generate plans that deliver on the promise of MSP? Here, we use a spatially explicit, dynamic bioeconomic model to show that stakeholder-generated plans are doomed to fail in the absence of strong scientific guidance. While strategically placed spatial regulations can improve outcomes remarkably, the vast majority of possible plans fail to achieve this potential. Surprisingly, existing scientific rules of thumb do little to improve outcomes. Here, we develop an alternative approach in which models are used to identify efficient plans, which are then modified by stakeholders. Even if stakeholders alter these initial proposals considerably, results hugely outperform plans guided by scientific rules of thumb. Our results underscore the importance of spatially explicit dynamic models for the management of marine resources and illustrate how such models can be harmoniously integrated into a stakeholder-driven MSP process.},

Various methods and approaches have been developed in different fields for different purposes, leading to confusion over the concept and practice of stakeholder analysis. This paper asks how and why stakeholder analysis should be conducted for participatory natural resource management research. This is achieved by reviewing the development of stakeholder analysis in business management, development and natural resource management. The normative and instrumental theoretical basis for stakeholder analysis is discussed, and a stakeholder analysis typology is proposed. This consists of methods for: i) identifying stakeholders; ii) differentiating between and categorising stakeholders; and iii) investigating relationships between stakeholders. The range of methods that can be used to carry out each type of analysis is reviewed. These methods and approaches are then illustrated through a series of case studies funded through the Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme. These case studies show the wide range of participatory and non-participatory methods that can be used, and discuss some of the challenges and limitations of existing methods for stakeholder analysis. The case studies also propose new tools and combinations of methods that can more effectively identify and categorise stakeholders and help understand their inter-relationships.},

  abstract = {The implementation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is ultimately a social endeavour to sustain or improve human well-being via the conservation of marine ecosystems. The degree to which ecological gains are realised can depend upon how economic, ecological and social costs (negative impacts) and benefits (positive impacts) are included in the designation and management process. Without the support of key stakeholder groups whose user rights have been affected by the creation of an MPA, human impacts cannot be reduced. This study analyses a three year dataset to understand the themes associated with the economic, environmental and social costs and benefits of an MPA in Lyme Bay, United Kingdom (UK) following its establishment in 2008. Methodologically, the paper presents an ecosystem based management framework for analysing costs and benefits. Two hundred and forty one individuals were interviewed via questionnaire between 2008 and 2010 to determine perceptions and the level of support towards the MPA. Results reveal that despite the contentious manner in which this MPA was established, support for the MPA is strong amongst the majority of stakeholder groups. The level of support and the reasons given for support vary between stakeholder groups. Overall, the stakeholders perceive the social, economic and environmental benefits of the MPA to outweigh the perceived costs. There have been clear social costs of the MPA policy and these have been borne by mobile and static gear fishermen and charter boat operators. Local support for this MPA bodes well for the development of a network of MPAs around the UK coast under the United Kingdom Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009. However, this initial optimism is at risk if stakeholder expectation is not managed and the management vacuum is not filled.},

In fisheries management and assessment, fish stocks are the fundamental biological unit, but the reasoning for the operational management unit is often indistinct and mismatches between the biology and the management action frequently occur. Despite the plethora of population genetic data on marine fishes, to date little or no use is made of the information, despite the fact that the detection of genetic differentiation may indicate reproductively distinct populations. Here, we discuss key aspects of genetic population differentiation in the context of their importance for fisheries management. Furthermore, we evaluate the population structure of all 32 managed marine fish species in the north-east Atlantic and relate this structure to current management units and practice. Although a large number of studies on genetic population structure have been published in the last decades, data are still rare for most exploited species. The mismatch between genetic population structure and the current management units found for six species (Gadus morhua, Melanogrammus aeglefinus, Merlangius merlangus, Micromesistius poutassou, Merluccius merluccius and Clupea harengus), emphasizes the need for a revision of these units and questions the appropriateness of current management measures. The implementation of complex and dynamic population structures into novel and less static management procedures should be a primary task for future fisheries management approaches.},

However, few studies have examined the ecological impacts of human-induced trait changes across large spatial and temporal scales and species assemblages. We compared behavioural traits and predation rates by predatory fishes on standard squid prey in protected areas of different protection levels and ages, and found that predation rates were 6.5 times greater at old, no-take (greater than 40 years) relative to new, predominantly partial-take areas (approx. 8 years), even accounting for differences in predatory fish abundance, body size and composition across sites. Individual fishes in old protected areas consumed prey at nearly twice the rate of fishes of the same species and size at new protected areas. Predatory fish exhibited on average 50\% longer flight initiation distance and lower willingness to forage at new protected areas, which partially explains lower foraging rates at new relative to old protected areas. Our experiments demonstrate that humans can effect changes in functionally important behavioural traits of predator guilds at large (30 km) spatial scales within managed areas, which require protection for multiple generations of predators to recover bold phenotypes and predation rates, even as abundance rebounds.},

The purpose of this randomized trial was to examine messages targeting (1) awareness/instructions, (2) utility, (3) affect, and (4) planning upon community and central depot recycling across eight weeks. One hundred and seventy-six community-dwelling residents between the ages of 18\textendash{}65 years who self-identified as having the potential to improve their depot recycling activities completed baseline recycling measures and then were randomly assigned to one of the four messaging conditions. One hundred and forty-four of these participants subsequently answered follow-up recycling behavior measures four and eight weeks later. Intention to treat analyses showed that depot recycling increased significantly from baseline to four weeks. The effect waned for community recycling while holding for municipal depot recycling at eight weeks. Distance to recycling depot (closer proximity resulted in greater community recycling), access to a car (low access resulted in greater community recycling), and baseline recycling behavior (no prior recycling resulted in greater behavior change) all acted as significant moderators of the effect. There was no time by group interaction among conditions. The findings support the use of basic instructions \textendash{} as a minimum \textendash{} for promoting depot recycling efforts and provide evidence that local community depots, in conjunction with municipal depots, are important to increasing recycling behavior.},

To facilitate new analyses, we developed a new database, the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database, for commercially exploited marine fishes and invertebrates. Time series of total biomass, spawner biomass, recruits, fishing mortality and catch/landings form the core of the database. Assessments were assembled from 21 national and international management agencies for a total of 331 stocks (295 fish stocks representing 46 families and 36 invertebrate stocks representing 12 families), including nine of the world's 10 largest fisheries. Stock assessments were available from 27 large marine ecosystems, the Caspian Sea and four High Seas regions, and include the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans. Most assessments came from the USA, Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Assessed marine stocks represent a small proportion of harvested fish taxa (16\%), and an even smaller proportion of marine fish biodiversity (1\%), but provide high-quality data for intensively studied stocks. The database provides new insight into the status of exploited populations: 58\% of stocks with reference points (n~=~214) were estimated to be below the biomass resulting in maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and 30\% had exploitation levels above the exploitation rate resulting in maximum sustainable yield (UMSY). We anticipate that the database will facilitate new research in population dynamics and fishery management, and we encourage further data contributions from stock assessment scientists.},

The quantitative criteria used by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess risk-of-extinction are compared with reference points used by ICES and other fisheries organizations for advising on fisheries management. Criteria based on numbers of individuals and geographic range appear to be in harmony with limit reference points and control rules used in fisheries management, with reference points indicating that fisheries should be closed well before there is any risk of extinction. However, there is huge potential for conflict between fisheries and risk-of-extinction approaches when considering the extent of population declines. Of 89 species examined, the decline criterion suggested a serious risk-of-extinction in 87\%, whereas most of the stocks were still within a zone that allowed fisheries management reference points to indicate that exploitation could continue. Much of the conflict seems rooted in different types of tolerance to risk between the two disciplines. The conservation-biology community acknowledges a high tolerance for ``false alarms'', to keep the probability of a ``miss'' very low, whereas tolerance in fisheries management is comparable for both types of error.},

Though conventional wisdom holds that the fishery takes the large majority of legal-sized male crab coast-wide each year, this has not been demonstrated analytically. We use catch and effort data and a Bayesian depletion estimator to estimate pre-season abundance of the coastal population of legal-sized male Dungeness crab from 1970 to 2016 (California) or 1982\textendash{}2016 (Oregon and Washington) and estimate that the fishery takes 9 \%\textendash{}98 \% of the legal-sized male population each year, averaging 66 \%. The percent taken has increased over time in all areas. We find that although fish tickets (landing receipts) have limited information on fishing effort, they lead to similar estimates of abundance compared to the more detailed logbook data. Fish ticket estimates of abundance tend to be slightly lower than logbook estimates. Logbooks also show evidence that catchability is time-varying or density-dependent (i.e., catch rates exhibit hyperdepletion), which is not evident in the fish ticket data. Pre-season abundance of legal-size males appears to be stable or increasing in all areas over the period considered in spite of the high rate of exploitation and large year-to-year fluctuations. In Central California, pre-season abundance has shown a particularly rapid increase during the past decade after a long period of low abundance, likely due to changing oceanographic conditions.},

Our empirical analysis discusses the extent to which this variation can be explained by common-pool resource (CPR) characteristics, controlling for institutional quality, island status, the existence of marine-protected areas, and the ratification of marine environmental agreements. Using data from the Ocean Health Index (OHI), we confirm that the problems related to CPRs are not restricted to fisheries. Other oceanic services and assets, including the provision of oceanic natural products, habitat health, and species richness, also decline with the number of neighboring countries. By contrast, the aspects of ocean health-like sustainable tourism, the preservation of iconic species, or the mitigation of trash pollution benefit from neighborhood stress. Overall, there is little evidence that economic development (expressed in per capita gross domestic product [GDP] and used as a proxy for institutional quality) contributes to sustaining oceanic resources.

However, maintaining healthy stocks to provide the maximum sustainable yield on a single-species basis does not ensure that broader ecosystem, economic, and social objectives are addressed. We investigate how the principles of a ``pretty good yield'' range of fishing mortalities assumed to provide {$>$}95\% of the average yield for a single stock can be expanded to a pretty good multispecies yield (PGMY) space and further to pretty good multidimensional yield to accommodate situations where the yield from a stock affects the ecosystem, economic and social benefits, or sustainability. We demonstrate in a European example that PGMY is a practical concept. As PGMY provides a safe operating space for management that adheres to the principles of MSY, it allows the consideration of other aspects to be included in operational management advice in both data-rich and data-limited situations. PGMY furthermore provides a way to integrate advice across stocks, avoiding clearly infeasible management combinations, and thereby hopefully increasing confidence in scientific advice.},

The fishing operational data are the official monthly records of estimated catch biomass and exact nominal effort of two artisanal fleets from 1995 to 2012. To transform catch in biomass to catch in numbers, a monthly trend in mean weight is estimated from biological compositional data from 2002, 2013 and used to produce predictions of mean weight for every month between 1995 and 2012. Estimates of natural mortality and initial abundance, thirty six fleet-specific abundance parameters, and six fleet-specific fishing operational parameters, are obtained by maximum likelihood. Thirty six additional timing parameters are fixed by graphical display of catch spikes, a convenient statistic defined here, and by maximum likelihood. The reconstructed history of the stock shows that the catch varies in direct relation to the magnitude of recruitment pulses, while nominal effort has been stable. The annual exploitation rate was estimated at approximately 10\%, which implies that fishing is occurring at sustainable levels, although these results are conditional on a well-behaved mean monthly weight in the catch and simplified statistical models.},

  abstract = {Fisheries on coral reefs are highly complex, can be very productive, but typically have little or no management. Widespread overfishing and declining yields reveal an acute need for proper management. However, conventional management methods are inappropriate for two main reasons: they require much information on the biology of stocks and are expensive and difficult to enforce. Use of marine reserves has been suggested as an alternative. Protective management potentially has several important benefits including (i) protection of spawning stocks; (ii) provision of recruits to replenish fishing grounds; (iii) enhancement of catches in adjacent unprotected areas through emigration; (iv) minimal requirement for information on biology of stocks; and (v) ease of enforcement. However, the effectiveness of the reserve approach has not been properly tested. We evaluate the evidence available to test whether reserves function as predicted on theoretical grounds. In general, field studies from widespread sites around the globe support predictions of increases in abundance and average size of fishes in protected areas. However, evidence for enhanced catches in adjacent areas is more limited, and evidence to show that reserves can restock fishing grounds is lacking. Nevertheless, protective management appears to hold much promise for low-cost management of reef fisheries. Research programs in several areas of the Caribbean and Indo-Pacific have now been launched to refine the approach.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Fully protected marine reserves, areas that are closed to all fishing, have attracted great interest for their potential to benefit fisheries. A wide range of models suggest reserves will be most effective for species that are relatively sedentary as adults but produce offspring that disperse widely. Adult spawning stocks will be secure from capture in reserves, while their offspring disperse freely into fishing grounds. Such species include animals like reef fish, mollusks and echino-derms, and models typically indicate that when they are over-fished, catches will be higher with reserves than without. By contrast, the same models suggest that reserves will be ineffective for animals that are mobile as adults species like cod, tuna or sharks. They remain vulnerable to fishing whenever they move outside reserves. Unfortunately, most models lack sufficient realism to effectively gauge reserve effects on migratory species. They usually assume that individuals are homogeneously distributed in a uniform sea and move randomly. They also assume that fishers hunt at random. Neither is true. For centuries, fishers have targeted places and times when their quarry are most vulnerable to capture. Protecting these sites could have disproportionately large effects on stocks. Furthermore, models rarely take into account possible benefits from improvements in habitat within reserves. Such changes, like increased biomass and complexity of bottom-living organisms, could alter fish movement patterns and reduce natural mortality rates in ways that enhance reserve benefits. We present a simple model of reserve effects on a migratory fish species. The model incorporates spatial variation in vulnerability to capture and shows that strategically placed reserves can offer benefits in the form of increased spawning stock and catch, especially when fishing intensities are high. We need to develop a new generation of models that incorporate habitat and behaviour to better explore the utility of reserves for mobile species. Migratory behavior does not preclude reserves from benefiting a species, but it demands that we apply different principles in designing them. We must identify critical sites to species and develop reserve networks that focus protection on those places.},

  abstract = {Several schemes have been developed to help select the locations of marine reserves. All of them combine social, economic, and biological criteria, and few offer any guidance as to how to prioritize among the criteria identified. This can imply that the relative weights given to different criteria are unimportant. Where two sites are of equal value ecologically, then socioeconomic criteria should dominate the choice of which should be protected. However, in many cases, socioeconomic criteria are given equal or greater weight than ecological considerations in the choice of sites. This can lead to selection of reserves with little biological value that fail to meet many of the desired objectives. To avoid such a possibility, we develop a series of criteria that allow preliminary evaluation of candidate sites according to their relative biological values in advance of the application of socioeconomic criteria. We include criteria that, while not strictly biological, have a strong influence on the species present or ecological processes. Our scheme enables sites to be assessed according to their biodiversity, the processes which underpin that diversity, and the processes that support fisheries and provide a spectrum of other services important to people. Criteria that capture biodiversity values include biogeographic representation, habitat representation and heterogeneity, and presence of species or populations of special interest (e.g., threatened species). Criteria that capture sustainability of biodiversity and fishery values include the size of reserves necessary to protect viable habitats, presence of exploitable species, vulnerable life stages, connectivity among reserves, links among ecosystems, and provision of ecosystem services to people. Criteria measuring human and natural threats enable candidate sites to be eliminated from consideration if risks are too great, but also help prioritize among sites where threats can be mitigated by protection. While our criteria can be applied to the design of reserve networks, they also enable choice of single reserves to be made in the context of the attributes of existing protected areas. The overall goal of our scheme is to promote the development of reserve networks that will maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functioning at large scales. The values of ecosystem goods and services for people ultimately depend on meeting this objective.},

However, their limitations are evident from continuing declines in fish stocks throughout the world. We make the case that to reverse fishery declines, safeguard marine life and sustain ecosystem processes, extensive marine reserves that are off limits to fishing must become part of the management strategy. Marine reserves should be incorporated into modern fishery management because they can achieve many things that conventional tools cannot. Only complete and permanent protection from fishing can protect the most sensitive habitats and vulnerable species. Only reserves will allow the development of natural, extended age structures of target species, maintain their genetic variability and prevent deleterious evolutionary change from the effects of fishing. Species with natural age structures will sustain higher rates of reproduction and will be more resilient to environmental variability. Higher stock levels maintained by reserves will provide insurance against management failure, including risk\textendash{}prone quota setting, provided the broader conservation role of reserves is firmly established and legislatively protected. Fishery management measures outside protected areas are necessary to complement the protection offered by marine reserves, but cannot substitute for it.},

We explore the role of managed ecosystems in mitigating climate change by promoting carbon sequestration and storage and by buffering against uncertainty in management, environmental fluctuations, directional change, and extreme events. We highlight both strengths and limitations and conclude that marine reserves are a viable low-tech, cost-effective adaptation strategy that would yield multiple cobenefits from local to global scales, improving the outlook for the environment and people into the future.},

  abstract = {This study challenges the widely held view that improved fisheries selectivity would always help to maintain marine biodiversity. Using a length-based multi-species model, we investigate the effects of selective versus nonselective fishing on fish communities. Both size and species selectivity are examined, and fishing effects on biodiversity are measured with three indices: (i) evenness, (ii) the number of collapsed species, and (iii) an index of size diversity. The model is parameterized for the Georges Bank and North Sea fish communities. The results suggest that there is no ``optimal'' size selectivity to maintain biodiversity: the effects of each exploitation pattern depend on the selectivity of the gear (i.e., the shape of the selection curve) relative to the available sizes. Catching a narrow range of species almost always reduced evenness and species richness more than taking the same catch from a broader range of species. In summary, neither selective nor nonselective fishing can be said to be gene..., Cette {\'e}tude remet en cause l'id{\'e}e r{\'e}pandue qu'une am{\'e}lioration de la s{\'e}lectivit{\'e} des p{\^e}ches aiderait {\`a} prot{\'e}ger la biodiversit{\'e} marine.

  abstract = {Empirical studies of climate regime shifts typically use confirmatory statistical techniques with an a priori hypothesis about the timing of the shifts. Although there are methods for an automatic detection of discontinuities in a time series, their performance drastically diminishes at the ends of the series. Since all the methods currently available require a substantial amount of data to be accumulated, the regime shifts are usually detected long after they actually occurred. The proposed sequential algorithm allows for early detection of a regime shift and subsequent monitoring of changes in its magnitude over time. The algorithm can handle the incoming data regardless whether they are presented in the form of anomalies or absolute values. It can be easily used for an automatic calculation of regime shifts in large sets of variables.},

Age class was included as a fixed factor within the model specifications, with the Year\texttimes{}Age interaction as a fixed factor component in order to obtain annual indices by age. Catch and effort data on bluefin tuna were available from two sources, catches by trip, and daily catches from logbooks. Catches were modelled using the delta-lognormal model. The model finally selected included the following explanatory factors: Year, Age, Year\texttimes{}Age, Month, number of Crew, number of Bait Tanks, and with the Year\texttimes{}Month interaction as a random component. Overall, year trends and coefficients of variation were similar from both datasets by age class. In general, the standardization procedure showed that vessel characteristics and technological advances related to fishing have a relatively minor explanatory effect on the observed catch rates of bluefin tuna in the fishery. Neither geographical distribution nor type of bait had an explanatory effect on the observed catch rates. The 1994 cohort stands out as an exceptionally large year class; it can be followed through the standardized series. This standardized catch rate index at age of bluefin tuna is the most complete yet available and is the only one currently used for juvenile fish in calibrating population models to evaluate the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean stock. It is particularly valuable because, apart from improvements in electronic technology, there are no changes in the method of exploitation during the entire series.},

Here we explore the ecological roles of sharks on coral reefs and, conversely, the importance of reefs for sharks. We find that most reef-associated shark species do not act as apex predators but instead function as mesopredators along with a diverse group of reef fish. While sharks perform important direct and indirect ecological roles, the evidence to support hypothesised shark-driven trophic cascades that benefit corals is weak and equivocal. Coral reefs provide some functional benefits to sharks, but sharks do not appear to favour healthier reef environments. Restoring populations of sharks is important and can yet deliver ecological surprise., Stable isotopes reveal that sharks span an extended range of trophic levels with true apex species being higher than most common reef sharks., Dietary analysis reveals that most common reef sharks are mesopredators occupying a similar trophic level to large piscivorous fishes., Evidence for shark-induced trophic cascades that benefit herbivorous fishes is weak or equivocal on coral reefs., Sharks can exert non-consumptive or `fear' effects that disrupt the foraging of potential prey., While coral reefs provide a range of ecological benefits for sharks, the link between healthy reefs and shark abundance is unclear.},

  abstract = {Shifts in phenology are a well-documented ecological response to changes in climate, which may or may not be adaptive for a species depending on the climate sensitivity of other ecosystem processes. Furthermore, phenology may be affected by factors in addition to climate, which may accentuate or dampen climate-driven phenological responses. In this study, we investigate how climate and population demographic structure jointly affect spawning phenology of a fish species of major commercial importance: walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus). We use 32 years of data from ichthyoplankton surveys to reconstruct timing of pollock reproduction in the Gulf of Alaska and find that the mean date of spawning has varied by over 3 weeks throughout the last {$>$}3 decades. Climate clearly drives variation in spawn timing, with warmer temperatures leading to an earlier and more protracted spawning period, consistent with expectations of advanced spring phenology under warming. However, the effects of temperature were nonlinear, such that additional warming above a threshold value had no additional effect on phenology. Population demographics were equally as important as temperature: An older and more age-diverse spawning stock tended to spawn earlier and over a longer duration than a younger stock. Our models suggest that demographic shifts associated with sustainable harvest rates could shift the mean spawning date 7 days later and shorten the spawning season by 9 days relative to an unfished population, independent of thermal conditions. Projections under climate change suggest that spawn timing will become more stable for walleye pollock in the future, but it is unknown what the consequences of this stabilization will be for the synchrony of first-feeding larvae with production of zooplankton prey in spring. With ongoing warming in the world's oceans, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying reproductive phenology can improve our ability to monitor and manage species under changing climate conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract We investigate the ``typical'' global and large-scale regional precipitation patterns that are associated with the El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Monthly precipitation time series from over 1700 stations are analyzed using an empirical method designed to identify regions of the globe that have precipitation variations associated with ENSO. Monthly mean ranked precipitation composites are computed over idealized 2-year ENSO episodes for all stations that include data for at least five ENSOs. The amplitude and phase of the Arm harmonic fitted to the 24-month composite values are plotted in the form of a vector for each station. When plotted on a global map, these vectors reveal both the regions of spatially coherent ENSO-related precipitation and the phase of this signal in relation to the evolution of the composite episode. Time cries of precipitation for the coherent regions identified in the harmonic vector map are examined to determine the magnitudes of the ENSO-related precipitation and the percentages of the time the identified relationship actually occurred in conjunction with ENSO episodes. This study expands previous results by placing the regional precipitation relationships into a global framework and by providing a consistent methodology for the definition of the geographical regions and the temporal phase of ENSO-related precipitation. In addition to the Pacific Ocean basin where precipitation patterns could be directly related to the ENSO, several other regions, which showed consistent ENSO-related precipitation, were identified. Specifically, four regions in Australia, two regions each in North America South America, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa and one region in Central America were all found to have coherent ENSO-related precipitation. In most of thew regions, the ``season'' of ENSO-related precipitation was found to be in phase with the normal annual precipitation cycle. Time series of area-averaged precipitation for the appropriate ``seasons'' show departures consistent with the composites occurring for at 1east 80\% of the ENSO events in almost every region. The analysis further indicates that variations in precipitation related to ENSO occur as early as April of the composite episode through May of the following year.},

  abstract = {Density-dependent processes such as growth, survival, reproduction and movement are compensatory if their rates change in response to variation in population density (or numbers) such that they result in a slowed population growth rate at high densities and promote a numerical increase of the population at low densities. Compensatory density dependence is important to fisheries management because it operates to offset the losses of individuals. While the concept of compensation is straightforward, it remains one of the most controversial issues in population dynamics. The difficulties arise when going from general concepts to specific populations. Compensation is usually quantified using some combination of spawner\textendash{}recruit analysis, long-term field monitoring or manipulative studies, and computer modelling. Problems arise because there are limitations to each of these approaches, and these limitations generally originate from the high uncertainty associated with field measurements. We offer a hierarchical approach to predicting and understanding compensation that ranges from the very general, using basic life-history theory, to the highly site-specific, using detailed population models. We analyse a spawner\textendash{}recruit database to test the predictions about compensation and compensatory reserve that derive from a three-endpoint life-history framework designed for fish. We then summarise field examples of density dependence in specific processes. Selected long-term field monitoring studies, manipulative studies and computer modelling examples are then highlighted that illustrate how density-dependent processes led to compensatory responses at the population level. Some theoretical and empirical advances that offer hope for progress in the future on the compensation issue are discussed. We advocate an approach to compensation that involves process-level understanding of the underlying mechanisms, life-history theory, careful analysis of field data, and matrix and individual-based modelling. There will always be debate if the quantification of compensation does not include some degree of understanding of the underlying mechanisms.},

These protections serve as a tool to help ensure the long-term sustainability of marine populations and act as a living laboratory to better understand outside impacts on marine life. California's network operates synergistically to meet the objectives that a single reserve might not. In 2006 and 2007, NOAA expanded this network of thirteen MPAs into the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary's deeper waters, at the time, making them the largest integrated system of MPAs of the continental United States. Historically, marine habitats around the Channel Islands were well surveyed by scuba divers to a depth of 20 meters, but the deeper waters remained poorly studied. Together, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE) developed a long-term Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) program to monitor the changes these MPAs show over time. ROV configuration, survey design and protocols, as well as data post processing and analysis techniques, were developed to specifically evaluate how marine populations respond to the establishment of a network of MPAs.},

  abstract = {The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act recognizes that fish stocks depend on healthy ecosystems and requires that fishery managers expand their management regimes to include the very basis of healthy fisheries\textemdash{}the habitat itself. The 1996 amendments to this primary United States marine fishery-management law include a new mandate to identify habitats essential to managed living marine resources and to take steps to ensure that those habitats remain healthy and can support sustainable fisheries. Until now, the legislative mandate for protecting habitat for marine and anadromous stocks came through statutes not specifically focused on the needs of commercial and recreational fish species. Now, there is explicit linkage between fishery-management programs, traditionally designed to manage the harvesting activity itself, and efforts to ensure that fishing and nonfishing activities do not undermine the productivity of the stocks. This emphasis on habitat health and productivity brings a broader ecosystem perspective to traditional fishery management. The insertion of essential fish habitat (EFH) provisions into fisheries management has been an enormous undertaking. The agency and the regional fishery management councils, working with other partners, completed the first stage of the process within very tight statutory deadlines. The councils have made use of all of the tools provided them under the act and the EFH regulations, such as designating habitat areas of particular concern (EFH-HAPCs), recommending fishing restrictions within special areas, defining priority research and information needs, and documenting threats and conservation measures appropriate for federal actions that may adversely affect EFH. This effort has entailed a great deal of scientific as well as policy analysis. We are currently implementing the federal consultation process to address threats to fish habitat in a consistent and timely manner. This new habitat thrust will align fishery managers and scientists with new allies in the habitat arena, increasing benefits to marine resource-management programs and fishery management. As suggested by the theme of this issue, an understanding and consideration of marine reserves and other special-area management concepts can benefit federal fishery management. This article gives an overview of how the fishery-management councils are fulfilling the essential fish habitat mandate by using a broader ecosystem approach to conservation that considers the ecological role of managed species, analyzes species' habitat needs from state waters to the high seas, and examines shifts in population health and sustainability over the course of decades.},

While the 149 stocks above 80\% of BMSY are conventionally considered ``fully exploited,'' stocks staying at this level for many years, forego substantial yield. Our results enable managers to consider more detailed information than simply a categorization of stocks as ``fully'' or ``over'' exploited. Our approach is reproducible, allows consistent application to a broad range of stocks, and can be easily updated as new data become available. Applied on an ongoing basis, this approach can provide critical, more detailed information for resource management for more exploited fish stocks than currently available.},

Based on systematic conservation planning principles such as representation and persistence, we identified large tracts of untransformed land (i.e., conservation corridors) for conservation that would achieve biodiversity targets for pattern and process in the Subtropical Thicket Biome of South Africa. We combined least-cost path analysis with a target-driven algorithm to identify the best option for capturing key environmental gradients while considering biodiversity targets and conservation opportunities and constraints. We identified seven conservation corridors on the basis of subtropical thicket representation, habitat transformation and degradation, wildlife suitability, irreplaceability of vegetation types, protected area networks, and future land-use pressures. These conservation corridors covered 21.1\% of the planning region (ranging from 600 to 5200 km2) and successfully achieved targets for biological processes and to a lesser extent for vegetation types. The corridors we identified are intended to promote the persistence of ecological processes (gradients and fixed processes) and fulfill half of the biodiversity pattern target. We compared the conservation corridors with a simplified corridor design consisting of a fixed-width buffer along major rivers. Conservation corridors outperformed river buffers in seven out of eight criteria. Our corridor design can provide a tool for quantifying trade-offs between various criteria (biodiversity pattern and process, implementation constraints and opportunities). A land-use management model was developed to facilitate implementation of conservation actions within these corridors.},

This, together with predation, physical disruption, and differing species tolerances to physiological stress, explains the structure of the ecological communities at some sites. At other sites the supply of larvae is limiting, and events in the offshore waters, such as wind-driven upwelling, explain the composition of intertidal communities. Whether the community ecology at a site is governed by adult-adult interactions within the site, or by limitations to the supply of larvae reaching the site, is determined by the regional pattern of circulation in the coastal waters. Models combining larval circulation with adult interactions can potentially forecast population fluctuations. These findings illustrate how processes in different ecological habitats are coupled.},

Engine power has often been estimated from subsets of the developed world, leading to inflated results. We disaggregated data into three sectors, artisanal (unpowered/powered) and industrial, and reconstructed the evolution of the fleet and its fishing effort. We found that the global fishing fleet doubled between 1950 and 2015\textemdash{}from 1.7 to 3.7 million vessels. This has been driven by substantial expansion of the motorized fleet, particularly, of the powered-artisanal fleet. By 2015, 68\% of the global fishing fleet was motorized. Although the global fleet is dominated by small powered vessels under 50 kW, they contribute only 27\% of the global engine power, which has increased from 25 to 145 GW (combined powered-artisanal and industrial fleets). Alongside an expansion of the fleets, the effective catch per unit of effort (CPUE) has consistently decreased since 1950, showing the increasing pressure of fisheries on ocean resources. The effective CPUE of most countries in 2015 was a fifth of its 1950s value, which was compared with a global decline in abundance. There are signs, however, of stabilization and more effective management in recent years, with a reduction in fleet sizes in developed countries. Based on historical patterns and allowing for the slowing rate of expansion, 1 million more motorized vessels could join the global fleet by midcentury as developing countries continue to transition away from subsistence fisheries, challenging sustainable use of fisheries' resources.},

  abstract = {Species occurrence and its dynamic components, extinction and colonization probabilities, are focal quantities in biogeography and metapopulation biology, and for species conservation assessments. It has been increasingly appreciated that these parameters must be estimated separately from detection probability to avoid the biases induced by non-detection error. Hence, there is now considerable theoretical and practical interest in dynamic occupancy models that contain explicit representations of metapopulation dynamics such as extinction, colonization, and turnover as well as growth rates. We describe a hierarchical parameterization of these models that is analogous to the state-space formulation of models in time series, where the model is represented by two components, one for the partially observable occupancy process and another for the observations conditional on that process. This parameterization naturally allows estimation of all parameters of the conventional approach to occupancy models, but in addition, yields great flexibility and extensibility, e.g., to modeling heterogeneity or latent structure in model parameters. We also highlight the important distinction between population and finite sample inference; the latter yields much more precise estimates for the particular sample at hand. Finite sample estimates can easily be obtained using the state-space representation of the model but are difficult to obtain under the conventional approach of likelihood-based estimation. We use R and WinBUGS to apply the model to two examples. In a standard analysis for the European Crossbill in a large Swiss monitoring program, we fit a model with year-specific parameters. Estimates of the dynamic parameters varied greatly among years, highlighting the irruptive population dynamics of that species. In the second example, we analyze route occupancy of Cerulean Warblers in the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) using a model allowing for site-specific heterogeneity in model parameters. The results indicate relatively low turnover and a stable distribution of Cerulean Warblers which is in contrast to analyses of counts of individuals from the same survey that indicate important declines. This discrepancy illustrates the inertia in occupancy relative to actual abundance. Furthermore, the model reveals a declining patch survival probability, and increasing turnover, toward the edge of the range of the species, which is consistent with metapopulation perspectives on the genesis of range edges. Given detection/non-detection data, dynamic occupancy models as described here have considerable potential for the study of distributions and range dynamics.},

Environmental data gathered by fisheries-independent monitoring in Tampa Bay from 1998 to 2008 were interpolated to create seasonal habitat maps for temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen and annual maps for depth and bottom type. We used delta-GAM models assuming either zero-adjusted gamma or beta-inflated-at-zero distributions to predict catch per unit effort (CPUE) from five habitat variables plus gear type for each estuarine species by life stage and season. Bottom type and gear type were treated as categorical predictors with reference parameterization. Three spline-fitting procedures (the penalized B-spline, cubic smoothing spline, and restricted cubic spline) were applied to the continuous predictors. Two additive, linear submodels on the log and logistic scales were used to predict CPUEs {$>$}0 and CPUEs = 0, respectively, across environmental gradients. The best overall model among those estimated was identified based on the lowest Akaike information criterion. A stepwise routine was used to omit continuous predictors that had little predictive power. The model developed was then applied to interpolated habitat data to predict CPUEs across the estuary using GIS. The statistical models, coupled with the use of GIS, provide a method for predicting spatial distributions and population numbers of estuarine species' life stages. An example is presented for juvenile pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum during the summer in Tampa Bay, Florida.Received February 10, 2015; accepted August 11, 2015},

In an experiment, one assignment of treatments is chosen and only the values under that assignment can be observed. Bayesian inference for causal effects follows from finding the predictive distribution of the values under the other assignments of treatments. This perspective makes clear the role of mechanisms that sample experimental units, assign treatments and record data. Unless these mechanisms are ignorable (known probabilistic functions of recorded values), the Bayesian must model them in the data analysis and, consequently, confront inferences for causal effects that are sensitive to the specification of the prior distribution of the data. Moreover, not all ignorable mechanisms can yield data from which inferences for causal effects are insensitive to prior specifications. Classical randomized designs stand out as especially appealing assignment mechanisms designed to make inference for causal effects straightforward by limiting the sensitivity of a valid Bayesian analysis.},

We then apply those principles to four cases in which large parts of marine ecosystems are being managed, and ask how including additional components of an EBM approach might improve the prospects for those ecosystems. The case studies provide examples of how additional elements of EBM approaches, if applied, could improve ecosystem function. In particular, two promising next steps for applying EBM are to identify management objectives for the ecosystem, including natural and human goals, and to ensure that the governance structure matches with the scale over which ecosystem elements are measured and managed.},

The Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework is a robust framework that has been used extensively to design policy experiments and empirically test theories and models linking ecological\textendash{}economic systems, institutions and the sustainability of common pool resource systems. A modified IAD framework is developed that transparently encompasses both process-oriented pressure-state-response (PSR) and structurally oriented sustainable livelihood indicator frameworks, thus providing a platform for ecosystem-based fisheries management policy experiment design and monitoring. An institutional approach to fisheries management facilitates critical examination of important cross-cutting issues, including assumptions regarding what comprises sustainability and how market, government and civil society organizations use strategic investments in capital assets and institutions to achieve sustainability objectives. The emphasis on capital assets keeps attention on the relative merits of alternative investment options in policy experiments.},

Under-reported catch is generally perceived to lead to overfishing, and hence, catch reconstructions are increasingly used to account for sectors that may be unreliably reported, including illegal harvest, recreational and subsistence fisheries, and discards. However, improved monitoring and/or catch reconstructions only aid in the first step of a fisheries management plan: collecting data to make inferences on stock status. Misreported catch impacts estimates of population parameters, which in turn influences management decisions, but the pattern and degree of these impacts are not necessarily intuitive. We conducted a simulation study to test the effect of different patterns of catch misreporting on estimated fishery status and recommended catches. If, for example, 50\% of all fishery catches are consistently unreported, estimates of population size and sustainable yield will be 50\% lower, but estimates of current exploitation rate and fishery status will be unbiased. As a result, constant under- or over-reporting of catches results in recommended catches that are sustainable. However, when there are trends in catch reporting over time, the estimates of important parameters are inaccurate, generally leading to underutilization when reporting rates improve, and overfishing when reporting rates degrade. Thus, while quantifying total catch is necessary for understanding the impact of fisheries on businesses, communities and ecosystems, detecting trends in reporting rates is more important for estimating fishery status and setting sustainable catches into the future.},

However, commercial fishers often state that stock assessments do not match their observations. We compared fishery-independent catch per unit effort (CPUE) and species composition data between the 1970s and 2005-2006 for reef fishes in the vicinity of Onslow Bay, North Carolina. Additionally, total mortality (Z) was estimated by means of a length-based catch-curve analysis. Effort (drops) by rod and reel focused on three sites, two inshore (30 m deep) and one offshore (125 m). The CPUE was compared between periods within each site and larger area (inshore, offshore). The CPUEs of red porgy Pagrus pagrus, vermilion snapper Rhomboplites aurorubens, black sea bass Centropristis striata, and gray triggerfish Balistes capriscus were greater in the 1970s than in 2005-2006 at specific capture sites. Conversely, the CPUEs of red grouper Epinephelus morio, white grunt Haemulon plumieri, and bank sea bass C. ocyura were greater in 2005-2006 than in the 1970s. The CPUEs of snowy grouper E. niveatus, blueline tilefish Caulolatilus microps, and gag Mycteroperca microlepis remained steady or increased between periods. Estimates of Z for snowy grouper, blueline tilefish, red porgy, white grunt, and vermilion snapper were generally greater in 2005-2006 than in the 1970s. Apex species caught in the 1970s but not in 2005-2006 included red snapper Lutjanus campechanus, silk snapper L. vivanus, warsaw grouper E. nigritus, and speckled hind E. drummondhayi. Catch rates and composition may have differed owing to differences in captains' skills and electronics despite efforts to standardize the fishing methods between periods. Estimates of total mortality are generally inconsistent with fisher observations and agree with recent stock assessments concluding that important reef species are overfished. Altogether, our results suggest that fishing and possibly other variables have affected the abundance and mortality of major species in this fishery.},

Following an initial peak during 1934\textendash{}1943, abundances were low until the 1977 regime shift benefited each species. During 1990\textendash{}2015, Pink Salmon dominated adult abundance (67\% of total) and biomass (48\%), followed by Chum Salmon (20\%, 35\%) and Sockeye Salmon (13\%, 17\%). Alaska produced approximately 39\% of all Pink Salmon, 22\% of Chum Salmon, and 69\% of Sockeye Salmon, while Japan and Russia produced most of the remainder. Although production of natural-origin salmon is currently high due to generally favorable ocean conditions in northern regions, approximately 60\% of Chum Salmon, 15\% of Pink Salmon, and 4\% of Sockeye Salmon during 1990\textendash{}2015 were of hatchery origin. Alaska generated 68\% and 95\% of hatchery Pink Salmon and Sockeye Salmon, respectively, while Japan produced 75\% of hatchery Chum Salmon. Salmon abundance in large areas of Alaska (Prince William Sound and Southeast Alaska), Russia (Sakhalin and Kuril islands), Japan, and South Korea are dominated by hatchery salmon. During 1990\textendash{}2015, hatchery salmon represented approximately 40\% of the total biomass of adult and immature salmon in the ocean. Density-dependent effects are apparent, and carrying capacity may have been reached in recent decades, but interaction effects between hatchery- and natural-origin salmon are difficult to quantify, in part because these fish are rarely separated in catch and escapement statistics. The following management changes are recommended: (1) mark or tag hatchery salmon so that they can be identified after release, (2) estimate hatchery- and natural-origin salmon in catches and escapement, and (3) maintain these statistics in publicly accessible databases.},

  abstract = {A frequent expectation of the use of marine reserves in management of coral reef fisheries is maintenance or enhancement of yields to areas adjacent to reserves by adult (post-settlement) movements from reserve to fished areas (the so-called 'spillover
effect'). Demonstration of this effect has been rare. This paper reports on some circumstantial evidence derived from underwater visual census monitoring of densities of large predatory coral reef fish [Serranidae (Epinephelinae), Lutjanidae, Lethrinidae
and Carangidae as a group] inside and adjacent to a small marine reserve at Apo Island in the central Philippines over a 10 yr period (1983 to 1993). The marine reserve (sanctuary) at Apo Island was established in 1982 and was protected from fishing for
the duration of the study. The non-reserve area was open to fishing by up to 200 municipal fishers using traditional fishing gear (bamboo traps, hooks and lines, gill nets and spears). Significant positive correlations of both mean density and species
richness of large predatory fish with duration of reserve protection (from 1 to 11 yr) were observed in both the reserve and non-reserve areas surveyed. The minimum distance from the boundary of the reserve to the non-reserve area surveyed was 200 m.
During the first 8 yr of reserve protection combined, the density of large predatory fish at distances 200 to 300, 300 to 400 and 400 to 500 m from the reserve boundary did not differ significantly from an even distribution (chi-squared test, p {$>$} 0.05).
During the period of 9 to 11 yr of protection combined, there was a significantly higher density of these fish in the area closest to the reserve (i.e. in the 200 to 300 m area, chi-squared test, p {$<$} 0.05). This visual census data is consistent with a
proposed model of adult fish export from the reserve to the non-reserve areas. Along with interview data collected in 1986 and 1992 that showed that fishers were unanimous that their yields had increased since the reserve was implemented, this study
provides evidence for export of adult fish from reserve to fished areas.},

Over time, the biomass of N. vlamingii increased by a factor of 40 outside but close to the reserve boundaries (200 to 250 m) but not at greater distances (250 to 500 m). In 2000/2001 hook-and-line catch per unit effort (CPUE) for
N. vlamingii was 45 times higher within 200 m of the reserve boundary than for all other fishing grounds combined, with 62.5\% of the hook-and-line catch records being recorded within 200 m either side of the reserve, in just 11\% of the reef fishing area.

No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) are much advocated as a solution to managing marine ecosystems, protecting exploited species and restoring natural states of biodiversity [1,2]. Increasingly, it is becoming clear that effective marine conservation and management at ecosystem and regional scales requires extensive networks of NTMRs [1,2]. The world's largest network of such reserves was established on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) in 2004. Closing such a large area to all fishing has been socially and politically controversial, making it imperative that the effectiveness of this new reserve network be assessed. Here we report evidence, first, that the densities of the major target species of the GBR reef line fisheries were significantly higher in the new NTMRs, compared with fished sites, in just two years; and second, that the positive differences were consistent for multiple marine reserves over an unprecedented spatial scale (\&gt;1,000 km).},

  abstract = {Overfishing can have detrimental effects on marine biodiversity and the structure of marine ecosystems. No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) are much advocated as a means of protecting biodiversity and ecosystem structure from overharvest. In contrast to terrestrial protected areas, NTMRs are not only expected to conserve or recover biodiversity and ecosystems within their boundaries, but also to enhance biodiversity beyond their boundaries by exporting species richness and more complex biological communities. Here we show that species richness of large predatory reef fish increased fourfold and 11-fold inside two Philippine no-take marine reserves over 14 and 25 years, respectively. Outside one reserve (Apo) the species richness also increased. This increase beyond the Apo reserve boundary was 78\% higher closer to the boundary (200\textendash{}250 m) than farther from it (250\textendash{}500 m). The increase in richness beyond the boundary could not be explained by improvements over time in habitat or prey availability. Furthermore, community composition of predatory fish outside but close to (200\textendash{}250 m) the Apo reserve became very similar to that inside the reserve over time, almost converging with it in multivariate space after 26 years of reserve protection. This is consistent with the suggestion that, as community composition inside Apo reserve increased in complexity, this complexity spilled over the boundary into nearby fished areas. Clearly, the spillover of species richness and community complexity is a direct consequence of the spillover of abundance of multiple species. However, this spillover of species richness and community complexity demonstrates an important benefit of biodiversity and ecosystem export from reserves, and it provides hope that reserves can help to reverse the decline of marine ecosystems and biodiversity.},

  abstract = {No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) are increasingly implemented for fisheries management and biodiversity conservation. Yet, assessing NTMR effectiveness depends on partitioning the effects of NTMR protection and benthic habitat on protected species. Such partitioning is often difficult, since most studies lack well-designed sampling programs (i.e. Before-After-Control-Impact-Pair designs) spanning long-term time scales. Spanning 31 years, this study quantifies the effects of NTMR protection and changes to benthic habitat on the density of tropical wrasses (F. Labridae) at Sumilon and Apo Islands, Philippines. Five species of wrasse were studied: two species of large-bodied (40\textendash{}50 cm TL) Hemigymnus that were vulnerable to fishing, and three species of small-bodied (10\textendash{}25 cm TL) Thalassoma and Cirrhilabrus that were not targeted by fishing. NTMR protection had no measurable effect on wrasse density, irrespective of species or body size, over 20 (Sumilon) and 31 (Apo) years of protection. However, the density of wrasses was often affected strongly by benthic cover. Hemigymnus spp. had a positive association with hard coral cover, while Thalassoma spp. and Cirrhilabrus spp. had strong positive associations with cover of rubble and dead substratum. These associations were most apparent after environmental disturbances (typhoons, coral bleaching, crown of thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks, use of explosives and drive nets) reduced live hard coral cover and increased cover of rubble, dead substratum and sand. Disturbances that reduced hard coral cover often reduced the density of Hemigymnus spp. and increased the density of Thalassoma spp. and Cirrhilabrus spp. rapidly (1\textendash{}2 years). As hard coral recovered, density of Hemigymnus spp. often increased while density of Thalassoma spp. and Cirrhilabrus spp. often decreased, often on scales of 5\textendash{}10 years. This study demonstrates that wrasse population density was influenced more by changes to benthic cover than by protection from fishing.},

The null hypothesis is that Zurcher's decisions on bus engine replacement coincide with an optimal stopping rule: a strategy which specifies whether or not to replace the current bus engine each period as a function of observed and unobserved state variables. The optimal stopping rule is the solution to a stochastic dynamic programming problem that formalizes the trade-off between the conflicting objectives of minimizing maintenance costs versus minimizing unexpected engine failures. The model depends on unknown "primitive parameters" which specify Zurcher's expectations of the future values of the state variables, the expected costs of regular bus maintenance, and his perceptions of the customer goodwill costs of unexpected failures. Using ten years of monthly data on bus mileage and engine replacements for a subsample of 104 buses in the company fleet, I estimate these primitive parameters and test whether Zurcher's behavior is consistent with the model. Admittedly, few people are likely to take particular interest in Harold Zurcher and bus engine replacement per se. I focus on a specific individual and capital good because it provides a simple, concrete framework to illustrate two ideas: (i) a "bottom-up" approach for modelling replacement investment, and (ii) a "nested fixed point" algorithm for estimating dynamic programming models of discrete choice.},

Actual policies often change more gradually, potentially reflecting costs associated with policy adjustment. We examine how including policy adjustment costs changes policy recommendations in models of fishery management. Specifically, we examine cases where policy adjustment costs increase at an increasing rate with the rate of change of fishing effort levels. We examine how accounting for these costs changes optimal management strategies in static and time-varying environments. Increasing policy adjustment costs results in optimal approach paths to stationary optimal solutions that are more gradual but that rely on oscillatory convergence. In time-varying environments, including policy adjustment costs smoothes optimal management recommendations, resulting in decreased variation in effort levels on the stationary part of the optimal solution, but increased variation in optimal stock sizes. We conclude that accounting for policy adjustment costs in this way leads to management recommendations that in some ways would be simpler for managers to implement (more gradual approach paths), but in other ways more challenging (oscillatory convergence) and that can affect where environmental variability is expressed in model predictions (stock sizes versus effort levels) while not suppressing this variability altogether.},

Although much attention has been paid to the spatial relationship between biodiversity value and threats, and between biodiversity value and costs, little is known about how costs and threats are spatially correlated. The orthodox assumption in conservation science is that costs and threats are positively correlated. Here, we adapt a classic economic theory of land use to explain how conservation scientists came to expect a positive correlation between costs and threats. We then use high-resolution, ground-truthed datasets of land sales and habitat clearance to show that this assumption is false in the state of Queensland, Australia. Our results provide an empirical counterargument to a widespread assumption in conservation science, and illustrate why spatial prioritization needs to include independent measures of costs and threats.},

  abstract = {The strength of interactions between predators and their prey (interaction strength) varies enormously among species within ecological communities. Understanding the community-wide distribution of interaction strengths is vital, given that communities dominated by weak interactions may be more stable and resistant to invasion. In the oceans, previous studies have reported log-normal distributions of per capita interaction strength. We estimated the distribution of predator\textendash{}prey interaction strengths within a subtidal speciose herbivore community (45 species). Laboratory experiments were used to determine maximum per capita interaction strengths for eight species of herbivores (including amphipods, isopods, gastropods, and sea urchins) that graze on giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) microscopic stages. We found that maximum per capita interaction strength saturated as a function of individual herbivore biomass, likely caused by predator/prey size thresholds. Incorporating this nonlinearity, we predicted maximum per capita interaction strength for the remaining herbivore species. The resulting distribution of per capita interaction strengths was bimodal, in striking contrast to previous reports from other communities. Although small herbivores often had per capita interaction strengths similar to larger herbivores, their tendency to have greater densities in the field increased their potential impact as grazers. These results indicate that previous conclusions about the distributions of interaction strength in natural communities are not general, and that intermediate-sized predators can under realistic circumstances represent the most effective consumers in natural communities.},

Replication of small no-take MPAs (marine reserves) in coastal areas at the global scale is more likely to occur if reserves are designed as investment opportunities \textendash{} `fish banks' that produce new profits based on ecosystem services such as tourism and fish production.

Given the right conditions, the net present value of the reserve can be between 4 and 12 times greater than the no-reserve counterfactual. In our model, (1) the tourism sector covers the costs of creation and operation of the reserve as an investment in a profitable business; and (2) fishers become shareholders and receive income from tourist access fees; their profits increase as soon as one year after the creation of the reserve. A series of financing mechanisms to create and manage fish banks is also proposed. If designed properly, fish banks can help restore marine biodiversity and ecosystem services, and can create jobs, help fishers, and bring in significantly greater economic profits than the absence of protection.},

The most rigorous projections suggest that we will not achieve the 10\% target in truly protected areas by 2020.

Newly compiled satellite data and machine learning now allow us to track individual fishing vessels on the high seas in near real time. These technological advances help us quantify high-seas fishing effort, costs, and benefits, and assess whether, where, and when high-seas fishing makes economic sense. We characterize the global high-seas fishing fleet and report the economic benefits of fishing the high seas globally, nationally, and at the scale of individual fleets. Our results suggest that fishing at the current scale is enabled by large government subsidies, without which as much as 54\% of the present high-seas fishing grounds would be unprofitable at current fishing rates. The patterns of fishing profitability vary widely between countries, types of fishing, and distance to port. Deep-sea bottom trawling often produces net economic benefits only thanks to subsidies, and much fishing by the world's largest fishing fleets would largely be unprofitable without subsidies and low labor costs. These results support recent calls for subsidy and fishery management reforms on the high seas.
Much of the economic profitability of fishing the high seas is dependent on government subsidies.

Changes involve each individual in a decision-making process governed by his/her own goals or constraints. Despite this reality, the complex dynamics of fishing has usually been ignored in designing management initiatives, which has contributed to management failures in many parts of the world. Fishers have generally been treated as fixed elements, with no consideration of individual attitudes based on their operating scales (geographical, ecological, social and economic) and personal goals. We review existing research on the social, economic and behavioural dynamics of fishing to provide insight into fisher behaviour and its implications for fisheries management. Emphasis is placed on fisher perception, and how fishers develop dynamic fishing tactics and strategies as an adaptive response to changes in resource abundance, environmental conditions and market or regulatory constraints. We conclude that knowledge of these dynamics is essential for effective management, and we discuss how such information can be collected, analysed and integrated into fisheries assessment and management. Particular emphasis is placed on small-scale fisheries, but some examples from industrial fleets are provided to highlight similar issues in different types of fisheries.},

Unfortunately, determining the extent of this inter-population connectivity in specific cases is quite difficult: larval dispersal is a complex result of several biotic and non-biotic processes, and marine larvae are minute creatures that are difficult to track or manipulate. Nevertheless, effective management of such open populations requires that we know how they are organized and interact. Coral reef fishes and many decapod crustaceans share patchy demersal distributions and pelagic larvae. We review progress made in determining connectivity among crab, lobster and reef fish populations, considering the questions that need to be answered and the techniques that have been applied. We highlight common research strengths and gaps among researchers working on reef fishes and benthic decapods, as well as those areas given greater attention by one group, the lead of which the other group will need to follow. Finally, we suggest that greater progress towards understanding dispersal and connectivity in the future will best be achieved by integrating the approaches we review into large-scale, multidisciplinary, collaborative research programs developed and carried out in association with natural resource managers.},

Precise targeting of compensating transfers, however, may not be possible when agents are heterogeneous and the planner faces constraints on the design of transfers. In this paper, I derive a necessary condition for an efficiency-enhancing policy to create a Pareto improvement that can be tested directly with data. The condition relates the size of efficiency gains to the degree of predictability between initial burdens and variables used to determine a transfer scheme. The main empirical application is to a gasoline tax to correct carbon emissions, with related results for other sin taxes also presented. Results indicate that it is infeasible to create a Pareto improvement from the taxation of these goods, and moreover that plausible policies are likely to leave a large fraction of households as net losers. The paper argues that the existence of these losers is relevant to policy design and may help explain the political challenges faced by many efficient policies. The paper concludes with several extensions related to this political economy motivation.},

A fundamental challenge with assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability. It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water quality in the USA. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated ecosystem assessments.},

The increased human presence has modified fishes' antipredator behavioural responses, and consequently flight decisions, as a function of their changed perceptions of risk. Understanding how fish react to human presence can help identify the most vulnerable functional groups/species and estimate impacts caused by human disturbance. Shoal and body size are known to influence fish flight initiation distance (FID; the distance between the predator and prey when the prey begins to escape); however, few studies attempt to test the moderators of these relationships. Here, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis evaluating FID of fish in response to human presence. Specifically, we investigated six candidate moderators that could influence the relationship between FID with shoal and body size. Our results showed that individual fish size was strongly and positively correlated with FID and the most important moderator that explained the variance in individual body size-FID relationship was shoaling behaviour. However, and somehow surprisingly, we detected no significant relationship between shoal size and FID. We discuss how these results can inform the development of fish conservation strategies and ultimately assist in the management of marine protected areas.},

  abstract = {We aimed to determine optimal methods of underwater visual census (UVC) for estimating the abundance of coral reef fishes exploited by fisheries in the tropical Pacific. Two main methods were tested using SCUBA: strip transect and stationary point counts. We assessed their relative accuracy, precision, power and efficiency (cost), and compared different census area dimensions, observer swimming speeds, and number of replicates. Twenty-five comparisons of the two UVC methods were conducted for 73 species from five families of coral reef fishes, on reefs in Australia and Fiji. Species were grouped within families based on their mobility. Few significant differences were found, either among or between strip transects and stationary point counts. The data were characterised by high variability, low precision and low power. A trend for greater accuracy in density estimates of small sedentary species with smaller census area was apparent, which probably reflects searching efficiency. Only one species group, the sedentary Acanthuridae showed differences between transects and point counts. Higher, hence presumably more accurate, density estimates were obtained with 50 m\texttimes{}5 m transects. Notably, point counts could be deployed in {$\sim$}70\% of the time of transects. A bootstrapping procedure demonstrated a consistent improvement in precision of density estimates with increasing number of replicates, but no appreciable change in precision was found beyond 10 to 15 replicates, in all species groups and for both transects and point counts. Consequently, and because of the high variability inherent in fish density estimates, we recommend that at least 10 replicates be used to quantify the species considered here. The power calculations showed that only large differences in density will be detected with the replication levels typical of UVC surveys. Power was greatest for the roving serranids, with a decrease in density of about 50\% detectable for this species group. We discuss the importance of carefully defining the behavioural attributes of species prior to selecting a UVC method. A method of temporal stratification in a count is described for censusing a range of species of varying mobilities. We suggest that fish mobility and search efficiency are key factors in optimising UVC methods.},

  abstract = {Different age classes do not generally experience the same rates of fishing mortality. The processes resulting in age- (or length-) selection operate at several scales. At the broadest scale, population-selection measures the age-specific probability of capture, while at the finest scale contact-selection describes the vulnerability of fish that encounter the fishing gear. Population-selectivity is the process most relevant to fish population dynamics and stock assessment, but it has received far less attention than processes operating at gear-specific scales. Despite wide recognition of the diverse shapes possible for population-selectivity, the processes determining these shapes are poorly understood. This paper develops a reasonably simple model of population-selectivity from a set of survival equations, coupled to allow movement between subpopulations, and explores the conditions necessary to produce different shaped population-selection curves. Important factors influencing the population-selectivity model are the gear-specific selection characteristics of the fleets, their effort levels relative to one another, the spatial distribution of fishing mortality, and the movement of fish between subpopulations. The model can generate quite complicated curves and has surprising properties. For example, under a wide variety of conditions, even though the same asymptotic gear-selectivity applies in all subpopulations, the overall population-selectivity will be dome-shaped unless fishing mortality is uniform across all subpopulations.},

  abstract = {Fishing operations on any given stock rarely generate fishing mortality that is uniform across all ages and sizes. Population-selectivity refers to a scaled version of the age- or size-specific fishing mortality experienced by a fish population. Although it is common to apply a sigmoid logistic curve for the selectivity produced by many kinds of fishing gear, the general characteristics of population\textendash{}selection curves have not been well examined. In this study, generalized additive models were fit to sets of selection coefficients taken from 15 recent stock assessments conducted using the virtual population analysis approach. The selection coefficients predicted by the models provided smoothed representations of the shapes and temporal dynamics of selectivity. Four broad types of selectivity were found: increasing, asymptotic, domed, and having a saddle. Four specific cases, each dominated by one type of selection curve, were examined in detail. For all 15 stocks, the population\textendash{}selection curves were not stable through time but underwent changes in shape, which in some cases were quite radical. Temporal variation in population-selectivity has important implications for the conduct of fisheries modelling activities such as evaluating management strategies and forecasting catch and stock size.},

  abstract = {Fishery selection (selectivity for short) is the term often used to describe the phenomenon whereby a fish stock experiences mortality due to fishing that is age- or size-specific. Selectivity operates both at a local scale, as in the direct interactions of individual fish with the fishing gear (contact selection), and at a stock-wide scale (population selection), as evidenced by the differential rates of fishing mortality-at-age that are generally observed in stock assessment results. All age-structured stock assessment models have some form of fishery selection to modulate the impact of fishing mortality on differing age-classes, but selection coefficients, from a stock assessment viewpoint, generally are nuisance parameters rather than a focus of attention. This paper provides an overview of the three main processes that contribute to and influence population selection: (1) physical sorting by the fishing gear or differential behavioral responses of the fish to the gear produce the phenomenon of contact selection; (2) differing selection properties of different types of fishing gear (e.g., trawl versus longline) in turn generate a composite selection curve that is a weighted average of the different kinds of contact selection; and (3) when the fish are not well mixed spatially, then the spatial distribution of fishing relative to the spatial distribution of the fish also affects population selectivity. Fishing mortality-at-age estimates derived from a published Virtual Population Analysis of Scotian Shelf haddock are used to illustrate the diversity of shapes that can be seen in population selection curves and their considerable temporal variability. A spatial model for fishery age-selectivity is then used to demonstrate that the maximum relative yield harvested from a stock can be a function of both contact selection and the spatial distribution of fishing.},

Specifically, we show how accounting for endogenous costs to cooperative exploitation within a patch alters the conclusions derived from models that assume sole ownership within each patch. Moreover, we demonstrate how strategic interactions between patches can cause the costs to cooperative exploitation in any given patch to increase.

Yet, because of the difficulties in matching quota holdings with catches, many argue that IFQs are not appropriate for multispecies fisheries. Using on-the-ground-experience with multispecies IFQ fisheries in Iceland, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada, we assess the design and use of catch-quota balancing mechanisms. Our methodology includes a mix of interviews with fishery managers, industry representatives, and brokers, literature review, and data analysis. We find that a combination of incentives and limits on use rates for the mechanisms provide sufficient flexibility to the quota owner without the fishery manager incurring excessive levels of overexploitation risk. Contrary to some opinions, these programs are evidence that it is possible to implement IFQ programs for multispecies fisheries and that they can be profitable and sustainable.},

  abstract = {Discussions on the use of marine reserves (no-take zones) and, more generally, spatial management of fisheries are, for the most part, devoid of analyses that consider the ecological and economic effects simultaneously. To fill this gap, we develop a two-patch ecological-economic model to investigate the effects of spatial management on fishery profits. Because the fishery effects of spatial management depend critically on the nature of the ecological connectivity, our model includes both juvenile and adult movement, with density dependence in settlement differentiating the two types of dispersal. Rather than imposing a reserve on our system and measuring its effect on profits, we ask: ``When does setting catch levels to maximize system-wide profits imply that a reserve should be created?'' Closing areas to fishing is an economically optimal solution when the value derived from spillover from the reserve outweighs the value of fishing in the patch. The condition, while simple to state in summary form, is complex to interpret because it depends on the settlement success of the dispersing organisms, the nature of the costs of the fishing, the economic and ecological heterogeneity of the system, the discount rate, and growth characteristics of the fish population. The condition is more likely to be satisfied when the closed area is a net exporter of biomass and has higher costs of fishing, and for fish populations with density-independent settlement (``adult movement'') than with density-dependent settlement (``larval dispersal''). Rather surprisingly, there are circumstances whereby closing low biological productivity areas, and even sometimes low cost areas to fish, can result in greater fishing profits than when both areas are open to fishing.},

The findings are drawn from mixed methods adapting a household livelihoods approach to develop household typologies. Three household typologies emerged: (1) high market orientation, high income, (2) low market orientation, low income, and (3) high market orientation, low income. Low income households are the most impacted by new institutions that contradict with temporal and spatial livelihood diversification strategies of resource users. Also, they have lost fishing grounds, material assets (gear), and access to subsistence farmland. These findings support claims that sustainable use conservation agendas need to better consider the differential livelihood strategies of fisherfolk, and other resource users, or efforts for livelihood protection and improvement will be undermined.},

In the urban areas of the developed world, water conservation has to a certain extent achieved the objective of curbing consumption, especially in the more compact European cities. Urban water conservation depends on changing behaviors by water users, which may be influenced by personal factors (related to variables such as age, income, education, etc.) or may follow stimuli coming from the economic (i.e., pricing), technological, or public awareness spheres. The relative merit of each of these factors, as presented in this review, remains inconclusive, and conservation behaviors may vary in degree. However, conservation is also influenced by nonpurposeful factors, such as urban design, population, economic profile, and productive base. This article also discusses the governance context in which urban conservation practices take place. It is argued that conservation may influence governance (for instance, in the emergence of new, decentralized decision making networks) and also that governance, and especially the consolidation of certain nonpublic actors with specific agendas, may drive conservation practices.},

  abstract = {Experiments in research on memory, language, and in other areas of cognitive science are increasingly being analyzed using Bayesian methods. This has been facilitated by the development of probabilistic programming languages such as Stan, and easily accessible front-end packages such as brms. However, the utility of Bayesian methods ultimately depends on the relevance of the Bayesian model, in particular whether or not it accurately captures the structure of the data and the data analyst's domain expertise. Even with powerful software, the analyst is responsible for verifying the utility of their model. To accomplish this, we introduce a principled Bayesian workflow (Betancourt, 2018) to cognitive science. Using a concrete working example, we describe basic questions one should ask about the model: prior predictive checks, computational faithfulness, model sensitivity, and posterior predictive checks. The running example for demonstrating the workflow is data on reading times with a linguistic manipulation of object versus subject relative sentences. This principled Bayesian workflow also demonstrates how to use domain knowledge to inform prior distributions. It provides guidelines and checks for valid data analysis, avoiding overfitting complex models to noise, and capturing relevant data structure in a probabilistic model. Given the increasing use of Bayesian methods, we aim to discuss how these methods can be properly employed to obtain robust answers to scientific questions.},

  abstract = {Ninety-six bigeye tuna (88\textendash{} 134 cm fork length) were caught and released with implanted archival (electronic data storage) tags near fish-aggregating devices (FADs) in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) during April 2000. Twenty-nine fish were recaptured, and the data from twenty-seven tags were successfully downloaded and processed. Time at liberty ranged from 8 to 446 days, and data for 23 fish at liberty for 30 days or more are presented. The accuracy in geolocation estimates, derived from the light level data, is about 2 degrees in latitude and 0.5 degrees in longitude in this region. The movement paths derived from the filtered geolocation estimates indicated that none of the fish traveled west of 110\textdegree{}W during the period between release and recapture. The null hypothesis that the movement path is random was rejected in 17 of the 22 statistical tests of the observed movement paths. The estimated mean velocity was 117 km/d. The fish exhibited occasional deep-diving behavior, and some dives exceeded 1000 m where temperatures were less than 3\textdegree{}C. Evaluations of timed depth records, resulted in the discrimination of three distinct behaviors: 54.3\% of all days were classified as unassociated (with a floating object) type-1 behavior, 27.7\% as unassociated type-2 behavior, and 18.7\% as behavior associated with a floating object. The mean residence time at floating objects was 3.1 d. Data sets separated into day and night were used to evaluate diel differences in behavior and habitat selection. When the fish were exhibiting unassociated type-1 behavior (diel vertical migrations), they were mostly at depths of less than 50 m (within the mixed layer) throughout the night, and during the day between 200 and 300 m and 13\textdegree{} and 14\textdegree{}C. They shifted their average depths in conjunction with dawn and dusk events, presumably tracking the deep-scattering layer as a foraging strategy. There were also observed changes in the average nighttime depth distributions of the fish in relation to moon phase.},

A subset of high-confidence filtered DT data was retained for 5807 fish at liberty for 30 d or more, for evaluating linear displacements from release to recapture positions. For the filtered DT data, days at liberty ranged from 30 to 1701 d (median = 187 d). Linear displacements ranged from 1 to 5372 nautical miles (M) (median = 936 M), with 71\% eastward and 29\% westward, and 95\% within 3614 M of their release positions. The data indicate significant differences in the linear displacements by release locations, days at liberty, and fish length at release. An unscented Kalman filter model with sea-surface temperature measurements integrated (UKFsst) was used to process 48 AT data sets from bigeye tuna at liberty for 30 d or longer, to obtain most probable tracks, improved estimates of geographic positions, and movement parameters. The 95\% volume contours surrounding the position estimates, along the most probable tracks from bigeye tuna releases along the 140\textdegree{} W, 155\textdegree{} W, 170\textdegree{} W, and 180\textdegree{} meridians show substantial overlap. For the pooled AT data sets, the median parameter estimates from the UKFsst model for errors in longitude ({$\sigma$}x) and latitude ({$\sigma$}y) were 0.52\textdegree{} and 1.75\textdegree, for directed eastward and northward movements (u and v) were -2.01 M/d and -1.41 M/d, and for dispersive movement (D) was 496.7 M2/d. The linear displacements and most probable tracks obtained from these tagging data demonstrate constrained latitudinal dispersion, some regional fidelity, some extensive eastward longitudinal dispersion, and substantial mixing of bigeye tuna between release longitudes. The amount of mixing of bigeye tuna among these release areas in the equatorial central Pacific Ocean, with those in adjacent areas of the equatorial eastern and western Pacific Ocean, is dependent on distances between areas, with, in general, the greatest mixing occurring between the areas that are closest to one another.},

Faced with a large reduction in harvesting days, 432 active vessels, representing 98\% of historical landings, joined one of the 17 sectors allocated catch shares. The incentives presented under sector management, combined with regulations of several separately managed, revenue-important species, led to changes in harvest strategies and the timing of landings for both multispecies groundfish and many other species targeted by the sector vessels. Temporally modified landings altered the exvessel market mix of a range of species throughout the fishing year, significantly affecting prices received as well as annual harvester revenues. Two counterfactual individual harvester landings' timing scenarios for 25 species are combined with independent fixed effects models of inverse dealer demand in estimating the revenue effects of catch shares during their first year. Aggregate gains of over \$30 000 000 were found to result from advantageous market timing changes brought on by more flexible catch share management.},

  abstract = {1. Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model. 2. Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model. 3. Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation. 4. Standardization (z-transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size. 5. The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects. 6. The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linear models (GLM) and linear mixed models.},

* Although the commercial exploitation of fish in the Gal{\'a}pagos did not intensify until the mid-1900s, issues of overexploitation and mismanagement are already of serious concern. However, to date, research on Gal{\'a}pagos fisheries has been largely species or island specific, and no long-term cumulative catch statistics exist.

* In this study, total landings associated with the industrial and artisanal fisheries of the Gal{\'a}pagos Islands were compiled and analysed in an effort to assess accurately the amount of seafood that has been extracted from this region over the last six decades.

* The total catch for all sectors from 1950\textendash{}2010 was 797 000\,t, of which industrially caught tuna made up 80\%.

* The results also show a high degree of fishing down within the in-shore ecosystem catch, whereby planktivorous mullets have replaced high trophic level groupers within the past three decades. This shift has coincided with the spatial expansion of the Gal{\'a}pagos fishing fleet to areas further off-shore, where predatory species are not yet depleted.

* In addition to legally caught and exported seafood, Gal{\'a}pagos waters are also prone to illegal fishing. Of primary concern are shark finning practices that have escalated in intensity since the 1980s.

  abstract = {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that biological diversity stabilizes ecosystem processes and the services they provide to society, a concept that has become a common argument for biodiversity conservation. Species-rich communities are thought to produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar ecosystem functions. Such variance dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio effect and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios. In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species. Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates, so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them. The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster than indicated by species loss alone.},

Variations on two methods of incorporating environmental effects were tested. The first method (``model'' method) utilizes a structural change in the stock\textendash{}recruitment function to adjust the annual expected number of recruits by a value, either positive or negative, equal to that year's anomaly in the environmental variable. The second method (``data'' method) allows for observation error in the environmental data and uses the time-series as an index to tune the vector of estimates of annual recruitment deviations. Simulation techniques were utilized to produce datasets of known quantities that were subsequently analysed with a widely used stock assessment platform. Under the circumstances simulated in this study, neither method could be said to have performed significantly better than the other in all situations. Because the two approaches handle years of missing data differently, the best approach is dictated by the available data, rather than a more appropriate method.},

  abstract = {The concept of resilience is widely promoted as a promising notion to guide new approaches to ecosystem and resource management that try to enhance a system's capacity to cope with change. A variety of mechanisms of resilience specific for different systems have been proposed. In the context of resource management those include but are not limited to the diversity of response options and flexibility of the social system to adaptively respond to changes on an adequate scale. However,  implementation of resilience-based management in specific real-world systems has often proven difficult because of a limited understanding of suitable interventions and their impact on the resilience of the coupled social-ecological system. We propose an agent-based modeling approach to explore system characteristics and mechanisms of resilience in a complex resource management system, based on a case study of water use in the Amudarya River, which is a semiarid river basin. Water resources in its delta are used to sustain irrigated agriculture as well as aquatic ecosystems that provide fish and other ecosystem services. The three subsystems of the social-ecological system, i.e., the social system, the irrigation system, and an aquatic ecosystem, are linked by resource flows and the allocation decision making of actors on different levels. Simulation experiments are carried out to compare the resilience of different institutional settings of water management to changes in the variability and uncertainty of water availability. The aim is to investigate the influence of (1) the organizational structure of water management, (2) information on water availability, and (3) the diversity of water uses on the resilience of the system to short and long-term water scarcity. In this paper, the model concept and first simulation results are presented. As a first illustration of the approach the performances of a centralized and a decentralized regime are compared under different scenarios of information on water availability. Under the given conditions of a regularly fluctuating inflow and compliance of agents with orders from a national authority, the centralized system performs better as long as irrigation is the only type of water use. Diversification of resource use, e.g., irrigation and fishing, increases the performance of the decentralized regime and the resilience of both. Systematic analysis of the performance of different system structures will help to identify properties and mechanisms of resilience. This understanding will be valuable for the identification, development, and evaluation of management interventions in specific river basins.},

  abstract = {Abstract Conventional approaches to natural resource management are increasingly challenged by environmental problems that are embedded in highly complex systems with profound uncertainties. These so-called social-ecological systems (SESs) are characterized by strong links between the social and the ecological system and multiple interactions across spatial and temporal scales. New approaches are needed to manage those tightly coupled systems; however, basic understanding of their nonlinear behavior is still missing. Modeling is a traditional tool in natural resource management to study complex, dynamic systems. There is a long tradition of SES modeling, but the approach is now being more widely recognized in other fields, such as ecological and economic modeling, where issues such as nonlinear ecological dynamics and complex human decision making are receiving more attention. SES modeling is maturing as a discipline in its own right, incorporating ideas from other interdisciplinary fields such as resilience or complex systems research. In this paper, we provide an overview of the emergence and state of the art of this cross-cutting field. Our analysis reveals the substantial potential of SES models to address issues that are of utmost importance for managing complex human-environment relationships, such as: (i) the implications of ecological and social structure for resource management, (ii) uncertainty in natural and social systems and ways to address it, (iii) the role of coevolutionary processes in the dynamics of SESs, and (iv) the implications of microscale human decision making for sustainable resource management and conservation. The complexity of SESs and the lack of a common analytical framework, however, also pose significant challenges for this emerging field. There are clear research needs with respect to: (i) approaches that go beyond rather simple specifications of human decision making, (ii) development of coping strategies to deal with (irreducible) uncertainties, (iii) more explicit modeling of feedbacks between the social and ecological systems, and (iv) a conceptual and methodological framework for analyzing and modeling SESs. We provide ideas for tackling some of these challenges and indicate potential key focal areas for SES modeling in the future.},

However, current modeling practice is unsatisfactory. A literature review shows that the elements of good modeling practice have long been identified but are widely ignored. The reasons for this might include lack of involvement of decision makers, lack of incentives for modelers to follow good practice, and the use of inconsistent terminologies. As a strategy for the future, we propose a standard format for documenting models and their analyses: transparent and comprehensive ecological modeling (TRACE) documentation. This standard format will disclose all parts of the modeling process to scrutiny and make modeling itself more efficient and coherent.},

Three examples from my early research, cited by Quinn in the lead article for this issue, illustrate a historical approach to model design. Although such analytical results provide useful tools for thought, they sometimes gloss over important assumptions and limitations. I describe the series of questions that led me from simple models to a more complete statistical framework, involving state space models and Bayes statistics. Modern fishery models often grow into complex structures that depend on numerous arbitrary choices about underlying deterministic processes, process error, and measurement error. Given this inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, I discuss scientific limits to quantitative fishery models and future prospects for devising robust management algorithms.},

Bubble plots and ternary diagrams portray variable age distributions and highlight distinctions between commercial and survey sample data. The models formalize important historical issues in catch curve analysis related to selectivity and recruitment variability, where a particular model corresponds to a prescribed vector of design parameters. The roles that compositional distributions (multinomial, Dirichlet, logistic-normal) can play in fishery data analysis are described, and Bayesian methods are used to examine how the distribution of a key mortality parameter depends on model choice. The framework provides a direct link between model designs and policy outcomes that depend on estimated mortalities or mortality ratios.},

Defining and benchmarking EBFM strategies for these incidental environmental impacts has been challenging, and this lack of consensus has, in part, resulted in a proliferation of eco-labeling schemes with variable and vague criteria for environmental targets. The performance of fisheries certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), the most prominent eco-labeling certifier, was compared to non-certified fisheries and evaluated against target reference points for a suite of metrics derived from the EBFM literature. Specifically we compared marine mammal bycatch, finfish discard rates, and gear impacts between MSC-certified fisheries and non-certified fisheries. Discards of non-target finfish and bycatch rates of marine mammals were no different between certified and non-certified U.S. fisheries. Observer coverage was no higher in certified fisheries, and many fisheries failed to meet the coverage level thought adequate to document bycatch of protected species. MSC-certified fisheries did have lower average gear destructiveness scores than non-certified stocks when weighted by landings but not when weighted by the number of fisheries. Our analysis indicates that MSC-certified fisheries perform better on some ecosystem-based sustainability metrics but are indistinguishable from non-certified stocks on others, and improvement is needed for all certified fisheries to meet quantitative goals for the collateral impacts of fishing.},

In southern California kelp forests, we investigated the size-dependence of the interaction between herbivorous sea urchins and one of their predators, California sheephead (Semicossyphus pulcher). Empirical tests examined how differences in predator size structure between reserve and fished areas affected size-specific urchin mortality. Sites inside marine reserves had greater sheephead size and biomass, while empirical feeding trials indicated that larger sheephead were required to successfully consume urchins of increasing test diameter. Evaluations of the selectivity of sheephead for two urchin species indicated that shorter-spined purple urchins were attacked more frequently and successfully than longer-spined red urchins of the same size class, particularly at the largest test diameters. As a result of these size-specific interactions and the higher biomass of large sheephead inside reserves, urchin mortality rates were three times higher inside the reserve for both species. In addition, urchin mortality rates decreased with urchin size, and very few large urchins were successfully consumed in fished areas. The truncation of sheephead size structure that commonly occurs owing to fishing will probably result in reductions in urchin mortality, which may reduce the resilience of kelp beds to urchin barren formation. By contrast, the recovery of predator size structure in marine reserves may restore this resilience, but may be delayed until fish grow to sizes capable of consuming larger urchins.},

By combining these data with spatial information on cumulative human impacts, we identified priority areas where marine biodiversity is most and least impacted by human activities, both within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). Our analyses highlighted places that are both accepted priorities for marine conservation like the Coral Triangle, as well as less well-known locations in the southwest Indian Ocean, western Pacific Ocean, Arctic and Antarctic Oceans, and within semi-enclosed seas like the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. Within highly impacted priority areas, climate and fishing were the biggest stressors.

We conducted a literature review of 390 studies to assess how fisheries characteristics affected management tool performance across both small-scale and large-scale fisheries. We defined success as increased or maintained abundance or biomass, reductions in fishing mortality or improvements in population status. Because the literature only covered a narrow set of biological factors, we also conducted an expert elicitation to create a typology of broader fishery characteristics, enabling conditions and design considerations that affect performance. The literature suggested that the most commonly used management tool in a region was often the most successful, although the scale of success varied. Management tools were more often deemed successful when used in combination, particularly pairings of tools that controlled fishing mortality or effort with spatial management. Examples of successful combinations were the use of catch limits with quotas and limited entry, and marine protected areas with effort restrictions. The most common factors associated with inadequate biological performance were `structural' issues, including poor design or implementation. The expert-derived typologies revealed strong local leadership, high community involvement and governance capacity as common factors of success across management tool categories (i.e. input, output and technical measures), but the degree of importance varied. Our results are designed to inform selection of appropriate management tools based on empirical data and experience to increase the likelihood of successful fisheries management.},

Evidence indicates that explicitly addressing tipping points leads to improved management outcomes. Drawing on theory and examples from marine systems, we distill a set of seven principles to guide effective management in ecosystems with tipping points, derived from the best available science. These principles are based on observations that tipping points (1) are possible everywhere, (2) are associated with intense and/or multifaceted human use, (3) may be preceded by changes in early-warning indicators, (4) may redistribute benefits among stakeholders, (5) affect the relative costs of action and inaction, (6) suggest biologically informed management targets, and (7) often require an adaptive response to monitoring. We suggest that early action to preserve system resilience is likely more practical, affordable, and effective than late action to halt or reverse a tipping point. We articulate a conceptual approach to management focused on linking management targets to thresholds, tracking early-warning signals of ecosystem instability, and stepping up investment in monitoring and mitigation as the likelihood of dramatic ecosystem change increases. This approach can simplify and economize management by allowing decision makers to capitalize on the increasing value of precise information about threshold relationships when a system is closer to tipping or by ensuring that restoration effort is sufficient to tip a system into the desired regime.},

  abstract = {The paper is based on a review of 22 case studies on fisheries co-management in small-scale, semi-industrial and industrial fisheries in developing and developed countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe, North America and the Pacific. Case studies are classified according to a typology of co-management arrangements. The typology is based on the nature of the decision-making arrangements between governments and users. Decision-making arrangements refer to the roles of governments and user groups, the management tasks and the stages in the management process. Eleven case studies are analysed in detail. The analysis shows that co-management covers a wide variety of collaborative arrangements between governments and users. On the basis of the information from these case studies, a number of observations are made concerning the determinants of the type of co-management regime in place. Determinants include the capabilities and aspirations of user groups, the type of approach, the difficulty of the decision to be taken, the type of management tasks, the stage in the management process, boundaries, types of user groups and political culture and social norms. The paper concludes with the issues that require further research.},

  abstract = {Predictions of future species' ranges under climate change are needed for conservation planning, for which species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used. However, global climate model-based (GCM) output grids can bias the area identified as suitable when these are used as SDM predictor variables, because GCM outputs, typically at least 50\texttimes{}50 km, are biologically coarse. We tested the assumption that species ranges can be equally well portrayed in SDMs operating on base data of different grid sizes by comparing SDM performance statistics and area selected by four SDMs run at seven grid sizes, for nine species of contrasting range size. Area selected was disproportionately larger for SDMs run on larger grid sizes, indicating a cut-off point above which model results were less reliable. Up to 2.89 times more species range area was selected by SDMs operating on grids above 50\texttimes{}50 km, compared to SDMs operating at 1 km2. Spatial congruence between areas selected as range also diverged as grid size increased, particularly for species with ranges between 20 000 and 90 000 km2. These results indicate the need for caution when using such data to plan future protected areas, because an overly large predicted range could lead to inappropriate reserve location selection.},

  abstract = {From 1998 to 2005, 537 visual fish surveys were conducted along a 50-km stretch of mangrove-lined shoreline in the vicinity of Biscayne Bay (southeastern Florida, USA). The shoreline lies directly downstream of a major wetlands restoration project that aims to return more natural salinity regimes to the western margin of the region's coastal bays. As part of a "baseline" ecological assessment, we applied the delta approach to examine spatial and temporal patterns of mangrove habitat use by three fishes: Lutjanus griseus (Linnaeus, 1758), Sphyraena barracuda (Walbaum, 1792), and Floridichthys carpio (gunther, 1866). Along a north-south gradient, seasonal variation in their size-composition and three abundance metrics (occurrence, concentration, and density) was quantified and overall correlations with water salinity, depth, and temperature were evaluated using multiple regression. Results indicated that the shoreline is used by subadult and adult L. griseus and by mostly juvenile S. barracuda; for both species, highest abundance metric values occurred during the wet season, generally increasing southwards. In contrast, F. carpio were almost exclusively of adult (mature) sizes, with greatest values during the dry season at the shoreline's northern extent. For all species, water depth and/or temperature had a significant effect on abundance metrics. positive correlations were found for L. griseus and S. barracuda abundance metrics, whereas the reverse was true for F. carpio. To date, most mangrove-fish studies have evaluated a single measure of fish abundance, usually density. We suggest consideration of occurrence and concentration, in addition to density, has value in an assessment and monitoring context as well as for gaining insight into how a given fish species disperses and clusters within habitats and across gradients.},

The objective of this study is to summarize risk management practices in use in fisheries and to present strategies that are not currently used but may be applicable. Available tools originate from a variety of disciplines and are as diverse as the risks they address, including algorithms to aid in making decisions with multiple stakeholders, reserves to buffer against economic or biological surprises, and insurance instruments to help fishermen cope with economic variability. Techniques are organized in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, risks are identified and analysed. Strategies presented in this category focus on decision analysis, including multicriteria decision-making tools, and the related concept of risk assessment. Then in the treatment stage, identified risks can be transferred, avoided, or retained using tools such as the Precautionary Approach, portfolio management, financial contracts to manage price risk and horizontal integration. Published fishery applications are reviewed, and some empirical examples of risks and risk management using US fisheries data are presented.},

Each household's actual water consumption was measured at baseline (pre-intervention), in the short-term (1 week post intervention) and the long term (4 weeks post-intervention). The results of the study indicated that for high water consumers at baseline, the knowledge deficit approach resulted in a more water consumption than the other three conditions in the short term and long term.

  abstract = {This study compiled available information on the dispersal distance of the propagules of benthic marine organisms and used this information in the development of criteria for the design of marine reserves. Many benthic marine organisms release propagules that spend time in the water column before settlement. During this period, ocean currents transport or disperse the propagules. When considering the size of a marine reserve and the spacing between reserves, one must consider the distance which propagules disperse. We could find estimates of dispersal distance for 32 taxa; for 25 of these, we were also able to find data on the time the propagules spent dispersing. Dispersal distance ranged from meters to thousands of kilometers, and time in the plankton ranged from minutes to months. A significant positive correlation was found between the log-transformed duration in the plankton and the log-transformed dispersal distance (r = 0.7776, r2 = 0.60, df = 1, 25, P = 0.000); the more time propagules spend in the water column the further they tend to be dispersed. The frequency distribution of the log-transformed dispersal distance is bimodal (kurtosis = -1.29, t = -4.062, P {$<$} 0.001) with a gap between 1 and 20 km. Propagules that dispersed {$<$}1 km spent less time in the plankton ({$<$}100 h), or if they remained in the plankton for a longer period, they tended to remain in the waters near the bottom. Propagules that dispersed {$>$}20 km spent more than 300 h in the plankton. The bimodal nature of the distribution suggests that evolutionary constraints may reduce the likelihood of evolving mid-range dispersal strategies (i.e., dispersal between 1 and 20 km) resulting in two evolutionarily stable dispersal strategies: dispersal {$<$}1 km or {$>\sim$}20 km. We suggest that reserves be designed large enough to contain the short-distance dispersing propagules and be spaced far enough apart that long-distance dispersing propagules released from one reserve can settle in adjacent reserves. A reserve 4\textendash{}6 km in diameter should be large enough to contain the larvae of short-distance dispersers, and reserves spaced 10\textendash{}20 km apart should be close enough to capture propagules released from adjacent reserves.},

Appl. 13: S159\textendash{}S169), providing information on 67 species. PD and dispersal distance are correlated, but with many exceptions. The distribution of dispersal distances was bimodal. Many species with PDs longer than 1 day dispersed less than 1 km, while others dispersed tens to hundreds of kilometers. Organisms with short dispersal distances were pelagic briefly or remained close to the bottom while pelagic. Null models of passively dispersing propagules adequately predict dispersal distance for organisms with short PDs ({$<$}1 day), but overestimate dispersal distances for those with longer PDs. These models predict that propagules are transported tens of kilometers offshore; however, many types remain within the coastal boundary layer where currents are slower and more variable, leading to lower than predicted dispersal. At short PDs, dispersal distances estimated from genetic data are similar to observed. At long PDs, genetic data generally overestimate dispersal distance. This discrepancy is probably due to the effect of rare individuals that disperse long distances, thus smoothing genetic differences between populations. Larval behavior and species' life-history traits can play a critical role in determining dispersal distance.},

Comparing data-based indicators across upwelling and comparable systems for communicating ecosystem states and trends. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 807\textendash{}832. A suite of ecological indicators was selected for communicating, in a comparable way, how fishing affects the state of several upwelling ecosystems and others in which small pelagic fish play key ecological roles. Detailed background and understanding of system-specific processes and changes is needed for proper interpretation of results. In particular, environmental forcing is important in driving dynamics in upwelling systems; fishing impacts cannot be understood without understanding the corresponding dynamics of the environment. The Saharan Coastal (Morocco) and southern Benguela, both having experienced upsurges in low-trophic-level species, differed from other ecosystems when considering indicator trends. The ecosystem off Portugal emerged as showing reduced signs of fishing impacts in recent years, although the change may also be reflecting climate change favouring recruitment and abundance of demersal stocks. The indicator suite confirmed general understanding that the Mediterranean ecosystems have been notably degraded for several decades. Results and conclusions from this descriptive synthesis are compared with other comparisons of more complex, model-derived indicators. Even in upwelling and comparable systems, the simple data-based indicators are useful in synthesizing information on the status of an ecosystem, in particular on the ecosystem effects of fishing, to provide an ecological diagnosis at the ecosystem level, to be used in decision-making. Indicators of recent ecosystem state and trends over time are needed to assess the effects of fishing, but more indicators measuring biodiversity attributes and environmental change would complement the suite, providing fuller assessment of the status of upwelling and comparable ecosystems.},

However, few studies investigate the responses of suites of both target and non-target fish species within an assemblage, which is an important consideration for ecosystem-based fisheries management approaches. Diver-operated stereo-video was used to assess the abundance and length of coral reef fish across multiple areas both open and closed to fishing at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia. After taking into consideration spatial differences in benthic habitat, the composition of fish assemblages was found to differ between open and closed areas. The target species, Plectropomus leopardus, was approximately two times more abundant in closed areas. Furthermore, 51 \% of P. leopardus were larger than the minimum legal length (MLL) for retention in closed areas compared with only 1.8 \% in areas open to fishing. Another target species, Choerodon rubescens was surveyed in greater abundance at sizes larger than the MLL in closed areas (64 \% {$>$}400 mm) in comparison with areas open to fishing (36 \%). A number of non-target species were also larger in closed areas (e.g., Kyphosus cornelii, Scarus schlegeli). In contrast, several non-targeted prey species were more abundant in open areas (e.g., Pomacentrus milleri was six times more abundant in open areas). Our results document complex responses of target and non-target species in closed areas at the Houtman Abrolhos Islands.},

Simple methods for parameter estimation are discussed.
A method is given for combining the relationship proposed with yield-per-recruit and biomass-per-recruit estimates obtained by any conventional method, in order to construct the yield curves relating total yield to biomass or fishing mortality. These yield curves may be used in a fashion similar to those obtained from general production models, but include explicitly the effects of actual growth (weight at age), and maturity data, and of actual exploitation patterns. They are therefore particularly useful for selecting target values for fishing mortality and minimum values for spawning biomass, and for estimating long-term sustainable yields in a moderately conservative fashion.},

  abstract = {Stock assessments use spawner-recruit functions to relate the reproductive capacity of a stock (e.g., total fecundity) to subsequent recruitment. The Beverton-Holt spawner-recruit function, perhaps the most widely used, is conventionally parameterized using a ``steepness`` parameter that describes the stock's productivity. This parameter highly influences predicted population dynamics and responses to exploitation. Unfortunately, steepness can also be difficult to estimate reliably from data typical of stock assessments. In such cases, estimation can be improved by drawing inference from other stocks with similar life-history patterns. In particular, Bayesian prior distributions can formally be incorporated into stock assessments to inform estimation of steepness. In the present study, we used a meta-analytic approach to compute a prior distribution of steepness, focusing on marine demersal fishes. We similarly computed a prior distribution of maximum lifetime reproductive rate, a parameter inextricably related to steepness. In addition, we tested relationships between steepness and two life-history parameters linked to longevity\textemdash{}natural mortality and age at maturity\textemdash{}to examine the common assumption that long-lived, ``K-selected`` species have lower steepness values. In neither case was steepness significantly related to the life-history parameter. Our results should be directly applicable in stock assessments that apply the Beverton-Holt (or Ricker) function to marine demersal fishes, such as reef-associated species of the southeast United States in Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico waters.},

  abstract = {An individual-based model named OSMOSE (Object-oriented Simulator of Marine Ecosystems Exploitation) is used to investigate the dynamics of exploited marine fish communities. It allows the representation of age- and size-structured populations comprised of groups of individuals that interact within a spatialized food web. Within each group, which constitutes the basic interaction entity (the `super-individual' in individual-based modelling terminology), fish belong to the same species, have similar biological parameters and behaviour rules. Somatic growth, reproduction, predation and starvation processes are modelled. Two rules apply for the predation process: for a given fish group, prey selection depends both on the spatial and temporal co-occurrence of the predator and its prey, and on the respective lengths of the prey versus the predator. Thus, fish feed regardless of the taxonomy of their prey. The strength of both predation and competition relationships therefore vary according to changes in relative species abundance. Preliminary investigations are conducted on a theoretical community comprising seven interacting species. The simulation results show how community stability can emerge from variability in species biomass. It is thus suggested that size-based trophic interactions, along with the existence of multiple weak links and species redundancy, favour community persistence and stability.},

  abstract = {The usefulness and relevance of size-based indicators (SBIs) to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) are assessed through a review of empirical and modelling studies. SBIs are tabulated along with their definitions, data requirements, potential biases, availability of time-series, and expected directions of change in response to fishing pressure. They include mean length in a population, mean length in a community, mean maximum length in a community, and the slope and intercept of size spectra. Most SBIs can be derived from fairly standard survey data on length frequencies, without the need for elaborate models. Possible fishing- and environment-induced effects are analysed to distinguish between the two causes, and hypothetical cases of reference directions of change are tabulated. We conclude that no single SBI can serve as an effective overall indicator of heavy fishing pressure. Rather, suites of SBI should be selected, and reference directions may be more useful than reference points. Further modelling and worldwide comparative studies are needed to provide better understanding of SBIs and the factors affecting them. The slow response to fishing pressure reflects the complexity of community interactions and ecosystem responses, and prohibits their application in the context of short-term (annual) tactical fisheries management. However, movement towards longer-term (5\textendash{}10 years) strategic management in EAF should facilitate their use.},

Within the IndiSeas WG, the evaluation of exploited marine ecosystems has several steps, from simple binary categorization of ecosystems to a more-complex attempt to rank them and to evaluate their status using decision-tree analyses. With the intention of communicating scientific knowledge to the public and stakeholders, focus is on evaluating and comparing the status of exploited marine ecosystems using a set of six ecological indicators and a simple and transparent graphic representation of ecosystem state (pie charts). A question that arose was whether it was acceptable to compare different types of marine ecosystems using a generic set of indicators. To this end, an attempt is made to provide reference levels to which ecosystems can be objectively compared. Unacceptable thresholds for each indicator are determined based on ecological expertise derived from a questionnaire distributed to a group of scientific experts. Analysis of the questionnaires revealed no significant difference in the thresholds provided for different ecosystem types, suggesting that it was reasonable to compare states directly across different types of ecosystem using the set of indicators selected.},

The selected indicators are presented, how they are calculated is explained, and the philosophy behind the comparative approach is given. The combination of selected indicators is intended to reflect different dynamics, tracking processes that display differential responses to fishing, and is meant to provide a complementary means of assessing marine ecosystem trends and states. IndiSeas relied on inputs and insights provided by the local experts from participating ecosystems, helping to understand state and trend indicators and to disentangle the effect of other potential ecosystem drivers, such as climate variability. This project showed that the use of simple and available indicators under an ecosystem approach can achieve a real, wide-reaching evaluation of marine ecosystem status caused by fishing. This is important because the socio-economics of areas where fishing activities develop differs significantly around the globe, and in many countries, insufficient data are available for complex and exhaustive analyses.},

Consistency was proposed as a property of the information criteria available in large samples. We carried out model selection in ANOVA-type model corresponding to catch per unit effort (CPUE) standardization using consistent information criteria (Bayesian information criterion, Hannan\textendash{}Quinn, or consistent AIC), which satisfy the asymptotic desirable property called consistency. The results of the model selections between these consistent criteria and AIC are different. Computer simulations using a linear regression model show that the selection performances of consistent information criteria in large samples are good compared with that of AIC.},

A method for left\textendash{}right unsymmetrical interval estimation based on the asymptotic normality of the natural logarithm of CPUE is also suggested.

We evaluated the selected limit and target control rule parameters under stochastic simulations by considering various performance statistics. Because of the complexity in determining an effective female spawning biomass that involves a mating ratio, we choose the total mature male biomass (MMB) regardless of crab size as the spawning index to develop the stock\textendash{}recruitment relationship for stochastic simulations. The MMB based F37\% appears a reasonable proxy for limit control rule while F45\% appears a reasonable target control rule. The corresponding limit and target harvest rates of legal size crab when the standing stock MMB exceeds the proxy MSY level are approximately 36\% and 25\%, respectively. The difficulty in establishing an appropriate stock\textendash{}recruitment relationship for this stock was recognized hence a precautionary F45\% target level was chosen.

In order to assess interactions among oceanographic and biological processes that determine larval dispersal patterns, we introduce a Lagrangian (or water-parcel-following) description of larval transport. This formalism is used to determine larval dispersal kernels (larval settlement probability distributions) for a range of ocean flows, planktonic larval durations and settlement pre-competency/competency periods. Paths of individual planktonic larval releases are modeled statistically and, by averaging over many individuals, ensemble estimates of larval dispersal are determined. Typical dispersal scales vary from a few km to {$>$}400 km. Modeled dispersal kernels are well explained using only a few readily available biological and oceanographic parameters, and derived dispersal scales agree well with population-genetic estimates, suggesting that the model has reasonable predictive power. An index for regional-scale self-seeding is presented, and is used as a tool to evaluate the efficiency of marine conservation areas. Finally, settlement patterns resulting from larval releases made over short times (days to months) should be comprised of a small number of discrete samples taken from the long-term averaged dispersal kernel. The resulting larval dispersal patterns will be quasi-random in both space and time, which will have important implications for the interpretation of settlement time series and the prediction of recruitment of sessile organisms.},

Methods In an anonymous survey of international participants in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, we investigated the pervasiveness and author perceptions of long-term implications of receiving of unprofessional comments. Specifically, we assessed authors' perceptions of scientific aptitude, productivity, and career trajectory after receiving an unprofessional peer review. Results We show that survey respondents across four intersecting categories of gender and race/ethnicity received unprofessional peer review comments equally. However, traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields were most likely to perceive negative impacts on scientific aptitude, productivity, and career advancement after receiving an unprofessional peer review. Discussion Studies show that a negative perception of aptitude leads to lowered self-confidence, short-term disruptions in success and productivity and delays in career advancement. Therefore, our results indicate that unprofessional reviews likely have and will continue to perpetuate the gap in STEM fields for traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences.},

The Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary in the western Gulf of Maine is a hypothesized foraging area for toothed whale species and an area of high human use, but odontocete habitat use there is poorly understood. While a large whale watch community provides a robust, long-term, opportunistic sighting data set, those data are not standardized. To overcome this limitation, we used point process models to analyze 10 yr of opportunistic sighting data. We identified spatial distribution patterns and environmental predictors for the 2 most common odontocete species in the sanctuary, Atlantic white-sided dolphins Lagenorhynchus acutus and harbor porpoise Phocoena phocoena. Habitat use differed among months, and depth, slope, substrate, and salinity were the most important and consistent predictors for both species. Models identified both persistent and shifting hotspots within the sanctuary. While presence was strongly associated with several covariates, environmental predictors did not fully explain shifting hotspots. This work highlights the importance of long-term opportunistic data collection and provides new knowledge on habitat use to inform assessment and management of potential human impacts on odontocetes in a federal marine protected area.},

  abstract = {A dynamic one-dimensional model of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along a coastline has been developed to investigate their impact on fish stocks and landings over time. The model is basically a cellular automaton implemented with a spreadsheet and is used to trace stocks and landings from the initiation of the MPA for several years under a set of three different scenarios for the allocation of fishing effort. In all cases landings decline as soon as part of the coastline is protected, but in every case they recover to their original level and above. The time it takes for landings to recover ranges from four to nine years and with two small MPAs (several small) the recovery is faster than with one large one of the same spatial extent (single large). These results indicate that although fishery closures through an MPA will undoubtedly have an immediate adverse impact on the fishing industry, the chances of full recovery after several years are good, and both the fishery and the fish stocks will benefit in the long run. Further, our model provides a null model on the impacts over time of MPAs that may iteratively be compared with real cases that have biological and social variables.},

The rationales for movement corridors are (1) to lower extinction rate in the sense of the equilibrium theory, (2) to lessen demographic stochasticity, (3) to stem inbreeding depression, and (4) to fulfill an inherent need for movement. There is a paucity of data showing how corridors are used and whether this use lessens extinction by solving these problems. Small, isolated populations need not be doomed to quick extinction from endogenous forces such as inbreeding depression or demographic stochasticity, if their habitats are protected from humans. In specific instances, corridors could have biological disadvantages. Corridor proposals cannot be adequately judged generically. In spite of weak theoretical and empirical bases, numerous movement corridor projects are planned. In the State of Florida, multi-million-dollar corridor proposals are unsupported by data on which species might use the corridors and to what effect. Similarly, plans for massive corridor networks to counter extinction caused by global warming are weakly supported. Alternative approaches not mutually exclusive of corridors might be more effective, but such a judgment cannot be made without a cost-benefit analysis.},

To some, the solution is to simply stop taking them from our oceans, or prohibit carriage, sale or trade in shark fins [4]. Approaches such as bans and alternative livelihoods for fishers (e.g. ecotourism) may play some role in controlling fishing mortality but will not solve this crisis because sharks are mostly taken as incidental catch and play an important role in food security 5, 6, 7. Here, we show that moving to sustainable fishing is a feasible solution. In fact, approximately 9\% of the current global catch of sharks, from at least 33 species with a wide range of life histories, is biologically sustainable, although not necessarily sufficiently managed.},

Identifying spatial patterns of bycatch is an important element in managing and mitigating bycatch occurrences. Because bycatch of these taxa involves rare events and fishing effort is highly variable in space and time, maps of raw bycatch rates (the ratio of bycatch to fishing effort) can be misleading. Here we show how mapping bycatch can be enhanced through the use of Bayesian hierarchical spatial models. We compare model-based estimates of bycatch rates to raw rates. The model-based estimates were more precise and fit the data well. Using these results, we demonstrate the utility of this approach for providing information to managers on bycatch probabilities and cross-taxa bycatch comparisons. To illustrate this approach, we present an analysis of bycatch data from the U.S. gill net fishery for groundfish in the northwest Atlantic. The goals of this analysis are to produce more reliable estimates of bycatch rates, assess similarity of spatial patterns between taxa, and identify areas of elevated risk of bycatch.},

  abstract = {Interpersonal communication presents a methodological challenge and a research opportunity for researchers involved in field experiments. The challenge is that communication among subjects blurs the line between treatment and control conditions. When treatment effects are transmitted from subject to subject, the stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) is violated, and comparison of treatment and control outcomes may provide a biased assessment of the treatment's causal influence. Social scientists are increasingly interested in the substantive phenomena that lead to SUTVA violations, such as communication in advance of an election. Experimental designs that gauge SUTVA violations provide useful insights into the extent and influence of interpersonal communication. This article illustrates the value of one such design, a multilevel experiment in which treatments are randomly assigned to individuals and varying proportions of their neighbors. After describing the theoretical and statistical underpinnings of this design, we apply it to a large-scale voter-mobilization experiment conducted in Chicago during a special election in 2009 using social-pressure mailings that highlight individual electoral participation. We find some evidence of within-household spillovers but no evidence of spillovers across households. We conclude by discussing how multilevel designs might be employed in other substantive domains, such as the study of deterrence and policy diffusion.},

With density-dependent stock growth, however, catch smoothing increases stock variability resulting in reduced average yields. The optimal management policy balances the catch smoothing benefits against yield loss. We calibrate the model to the Alaskan pacific halibut fishery to demonstrate the main insights.},

These considerations are important for forage fish fisheries, because these species provide ecosystem services as a key prey in food webs and support valuable commercial fisheries. Forage fish stocks fluctuate naturally, and fishing may make these fluctuations more pronounced, yet harvest strategies intended to ameliorate these effects might adversely affect fisheries and communities. Here, we evaluate trade-offs among a diverse suite of management objectives by simulating outcomes from several harvest strategies on forage fish species. We demonstrate that some trade-offs (like those between catches and minimizing collapse length) were universal among forage species and could not be eliminated by the use of different control rules. We also demonstrate that trade-offs vary among forage fish species, with strong trade-offs between stable, high catches and high-biomass periods (``bonanzas'') for menhaden- and anchovy-like fish, and counterintuitive trade-offs for sardine-like fish between shorter collapses and longer bonanzas. We find that harvest strategies designed to maintain stability in catches will result in more severe collapses. Finally, we show that the ability of assessments to detect rapid changes in population status greatly affects control rule performance and the degree and type of trade-offs, increasing the risk and severity of collapses and reducing catches. Together, these results demonstrate that while default harvest strategies are useful in data-poor situations, management strategy evaluations that are tailored to specific forage fish may better balance trade-offs.},

Sardine (Sardinops spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis spp.) have long been used as an example of this pattern because low-frequency variation in catches of these species appears to occur out of phase, suggesting that fisheries and generalist predators could be buffered against shifts in productivity of a single species. Using landings data and biomass and recruitment estimates from five regions, we find that species do not have equivalent peak abundances, suggesting that high abundance in one species does not compensate for low abundance in the other. We find that globally there is a stronger pattern of asynchrony in landings compared to biomass, such that landings data have exaggerated the patterns of asynchrony. Finally, we show that power to detect decadal asynchrony is poor, requiring a time series more than twice the length of the period of fluctuation. These results indicate that it is unlikely that the dynamics of these two species are compensatory enough to buffer fisheries and predators from changes in abundance, and that the measurements of asynchrony have largely been a statistical artefact of using short time series and landings data to infer ecology.},

  abstract = {Natural mortality (M) is both a highly consequential and difficult process to estimate in stock assessments. Because of its correlation with other influential parameters, and the inadequacy of data to understand how it varies with time and ontogeny, estimates of M from integrated assessment models are often considered implausible. This has lead to the assumption that estimates of M are highly uncertain within integrated assessments and it is commonly fixed at values consistent with understanding about the stock's life history or derived from external analyses. Researchers recently used simulation analysis to challenge this assumption and provided evidence that M might be estimable under certain conditions. Our research builds upon those results by using the recently proposed age-structured production model diagnostic to help identify the conditions under which M might be estimable. This diagnostic aims to determine if changes in the scale and trend of stock abundance can be explained by catch alone, which is a key indicator of the presence of a production function. We apply the production model diagnostic to the same suit of assessments used in the aforementioned simulations to determine if a relationship between estimability of M and the presence of a production function can be identified. Statistical and subjective approaches to interpreting the production model diagnostic were developed with the aim of providing guidance on when M might be estimable. Statistical approaches to identifying the presence/absence of a production function did not outperform the subjective measure, but meaningful guidance about estimating M is still apparent. Our results provide more weight to the notion of M being estimable under certain conditions, and we provide guidance on identifying those conditions.},

This conjunction of issues can result in high levels of contention and poor outcomes in the management process. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) can assist in the resolution of these issues. MSE involves assessing the consequences of a range of management options and laying bare the trade-offs in performance across a range of management objectives. Key steps in the approach involve turning broad objectives into specific and quantifiable performance indicators, identifying and incorporating key uncertainties in the evaluation, and communicating the results effectively to client groups and decision-makers. At a technical level, the framework facilitates dealing with multiple objectives and uncertainties in prediction. At the implementation level, it fails if it cannot accommodate effective stakeholder participation and acceptance. MSE shares many features with approaches such as adaptive management and development of management procedures. The principles for implementing the MSE approach are reviewed and practical aspects of its implementation under the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) partnership model to fisheries management are discussed. The model stresses stakeholder involvement in all key areas of fisheries management, from stock assessment and setting research priorities, to enforcement and decision-making. Stakeholder involvement, including industry, science, and conservation, extends from membership of the AFMA Board, through Management Advisory Committees to Fisheries Assessment Groups. The benefits and limitations of the AFMA partnership approach are reviewed, both for MSE, and, in a wider sense, in the development of an effective fisheries management system.},

Most modeling of reserves employs simplifying assumptions about the behavior of fishermen in response to spatial closures. We show that a realistic depiction of fishermen behavior dramatically alters the conclusions about reserves. We develop, estimate, and calibrate an integrated bioeconomic model of the sea urchin fishery in northern California and use it to simulate reserve policies. Our behavioral model shows how economic incentives determine both participation and location choices of fishermen. We compare simulations with behavioral response to biological modeling that presumes that effort is spatially uniform and unresponsive to economic incentives. We demonstrate that optimistic conclusions about reserves may be an artifact of simplifying assumptions that ignore economic behavior.},

  abstract = {The size at the onset of sexual maturity (SOM) of female crustaceans is typically estimated using logistic regression analysis of the proportions of mature females in sequential size classes. The validity of this approach depends on the composition of the samples reflecting accurately that present in the environment. However, catches obtained by traps, a passive fishing method, typically contain disproportionately greater numbers of large crabs, whereas those obtained using active fishing methods, such as seine-netting and otter trawling, will presumably represent far better the size composition of the population. Moreover, we demonstrate that samples of female Portunus pelagicus caught by trapping were predominantly mature, whereas those collected by seining and trawling contained numerous immature as well as mature females. Therefore, the samples of females collected by trap are clearly biased towards mature crabs. Consequently, for any size class, it would be predicted that the proportion of mature females in trap catches will be overestimated, so shifting the logistic curve fitted to the proportions of mature crabs in each size class to the left, and yielding an underestimate of the SOM. This conclusion is substantiated by the fact that the carapace width of female Portunus pelagicus, at which 50\% of individuals reach maturity (SOM50), was estimated to be markedly greater when using the proportion of mature females obtained by seine-netting and otter trawling, i.e. 101.1 mm, than by trapping, i.e. 86.1 mm. Data on the size and maturity status of the deep-sea crabs Hypothalassia acerba and Chaceon bicolor are available only from trap catches. From the above data for P. pelagicus, it is considered likely that, through a greater vulnerability of mature females of these species to capture by traps, the respective SOM50s derived for female H. acerba and C. bicolor from trap samples (carapace lengths of 69.7 and 90.5 mm) will be considerable underestimates of the true values.},

This paper adapts methods from program evaluation to quantify the effects of establishing a marine reserve on fisheries using fishery-dependent data. The approach analyzes the effects of a policy at the individual vessel level and accommodates the coarse spatial resolution of fishing logbooks. It illuminates implicit assumptions in previous retrospective analyses of marine reserves that are unlikely to hold for large-scale fisheries. We illustrate the empirical model with an application to the Gulf of Mexico reef-fish fishery. Isolating the effects of reserves requires a full accounting of multiple gear production technologies, heterogeneity in vessel captain skill, spatial heterogeneity of fish stocks, seasonal patterns in abundance, the effects of coexisting management policies, and the possibility that the harvest sector anticipates reserve establishment. We find that the effect of two recently established marine reserves on catch is negative and trending downward, though the reserves have only been in place for 4.5 years.},

Scientific tools to support the practical implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 64: 633\textendash{}639. Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) has emerged during the past 5 y as an alternative approach to single-species fishery management. To date, policy development has generally outstripped application and implementation. The EBFM approach has been broadly adopted at a policy level within Australia through a variety of instruments including fisheries legislation, environmental legislation, and a national policy on integrated oceans management. The speed of policy adoption has necessitated equally rapid development of scientific and management tools to support practical implementation. We discuss some of the scientific tools that have been developed to meet this need. These tools include extension of the management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach to evaluate broader ecosystem-based fishery management strategies (using the Atlantis modelling framework), development of new approaches to ecological risk assessment (ERA) for evaluating the ecological impacts of fishing, and development of a harvest strategy framework (HSF) and policy that forms the basis for a broader EBFM strategy. The practical application of these tools (MSE, ERA, and HSF) is illustrated for the southern and eastern fisheries of Australia.},

The harvest strategy framework has been applied from 2005 to 2007, resulting in substantial reductions in quotas across the fishery. The experience in implementing the framework, both positive and negative, is described, and general lessons are drawn. Key lessons include the importance of formally testing such strategies using management strategy evaluation, the impact of external management drivers on implementation of the approach, the need to define strategies for setting ``bycatch quotas'' in multi-species fisheries, and the need for flexibility and pragmatism in the early stages of implementing such an approach.},

We use a discrete choice model of commercial fishermen's behavior to examine both the short-run and long-run opportunity costs of marine reserves.

There are five unresolved methodological issues: (1) which is the best estimator, (2) how one should determine the first age-group to use in the analysis, (3) how the variance estimators perform; and, for regression estimators, (4) how the observations should be weighted, including (5) whether and how the oldest ages should be truncated. We used analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the three catch-curve methods, including unweighted and weighted versions of the regression estimator. We evaluated four criteria for specifying the first age-class used. Regression estimators were evaluated with four different methods of right data truncation. Heincke's method performed poorly and is generally not recommended. The two-tailed {$\chi$}2 test and one-tailed z-test for full selectivity described by Chapman and Robson did not perform as well as simpler criteria and are not recommended. Estimates with the lowest mean square error were generally provided by (1) the Chapman\textendash{}Robson estimator with the age of full recruitment being the age of maximum catch plus 1 year and (2) the weighted regression estimator with the age of full recruitment being the age of maximum catch and with no right truncation. Differences in performance between the two methods were small ({$<$}6\% of Z). The Chapman\textendash{}Robson estimator of the variance of had large negative bias when not corrected for overdispersion; once corrected, it performed as well as or better than all other variance estimators evaluated. The regression variance estimator is generally precise and slightly negatively biased. We recommend that the traditional Chapman\textendash{}Robson approach be corrected for overdispersion and used routinely to estimate Z. Weighted linear regression may work slightly better but is completely ad hoc. Unweighted linear regression should no longer be used for analyzing catch-curve data.

Another, more flexible, peaked selection curve is proposed, which is derived by combining multiple logistic distributions. While the logistic distribution is frequently used to describe monotonic selection curves, incorporating multiple logistic equations (that describe either the increasing or decreasing catchability) can define a large range of asymmetric peaked selection curves.

However, testing of fundamental assumptions such as system structure or process formulations is rarely done. In this study, we compare the output of three different ecosystem models (Atlantis, Ecopath with Ecosim, and OSMOSE) applied to the same ecosystem (the southern Benguela), to explore which ecosystem effects of fishing are most sensitive to model uncertainty. We subjected the models to two contrasting fishing pressure scenarios, applying high fishing pressure to either small pelagic fish or to adult hake. We compared the resulting model behaviour at a system level, and also at the level of model groups. We analysed the outputs in terms of various commonly used ecosystem indicators, and found some similarities in the overall behaviour of the models, despite major differences in model formulation and assumptions. Direction of change in system-level indicators was consistent for all models under the hake pressure scenario, although discrepancies emerged under the small-pelagic-fish scenario. Studying biomass response of individual model groups was key to understanding more integrated system-level metrics. All three models are based on existing knowledge of the system, and the convergence of model results increases confidence in the robustness of the model outputs. Points of divergence in the model results suggest important areas of future study. The use of feeding guilds to provide indicators for fish species at an aggregated level was explored, and proved to be an interesting alternative to aggregation by trophic level.},

Anchovy spawned mainly over the continental shelf of the Thracian Sea in the east (directly affected by Black Sea waters), and the semi-enclosed Thermaikos Gulf and Evoikos Gulf in the west. The surveyed area was therefore post-stratified into an eastern and western region and DEPM parameters, which, in certain years, differed markedly between the two areas, were estimated separately for the two strata. To increase precision of the daily egg production estimates, both eggs and yolk sac larvae were used assuming that the mortality rate does not change between the egg and yolk sac larval stage. Embryonic mortality increased as a power function of temperature. The estimation of spawning fraction was based on the postovulatory follicles (POFs) method and was particularly complicated due to the presence of strong thermoclines and diel vertical migration of the fish: POF absorption was very fast during the night, when fish were located above the thermocline ({$>$}20~\textdegree{}C), but relatively slow during the day, when fish were close to the bottom at \textasciitilde{}14-15~\textdegree{}C. Mean relative batch fecundity was significantly related to somatic condition (energy reserves) whereas spawning frequency was related to liver condition (presumably, direct food intake). In comparing daily specific fecundities (DSFs) with concurrent estimates of mesozooplankton biomass and total anchovy biomass (independently derived from acoustic sampling) evidence for strong density-dependence in DSF emerged. Density-dependent use (expansion-contraction) of the spawning habitat (SA), indexed by the ratio CV(SA)/CV(SSB), was relatively low but density-dependency of egg production CV(DSF)/CV(SSB) was particularly high in the N.

This tutorial provides a practical introduction to fitting LMMs in a Bayesian framework using the probabilistic programming language Stan. We choose Stan (rather than WinBUGS or JAGS) because it provides an elegant and scalable framework for fitting models in most of the standard applications of LMMs. We ease the reader into fitting increasingly complex LMMs, first using a two-condition repeated measures self-paced reading study, followed by a more complex \$2\textbackslash{}times 2\$ repeated measures factorial design that can be generalized to much more complex designs.},

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of fishing effort plays a key role in predicting the impacts of regulatory measures on fisheries. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of bio-economic models to represent and analyze the short-term dynamics of fishing effort in response to regulation in the fisheries management literature. In this literature, fishing firms are usually modeled as autonomous decision-making units determining their harvest strategies so as to maximize profit, given technical and institutional constraints. The overall dynamics of a fishery is modeled as the result of these individual choices, and of interactions between individual choices due to the impacts of harvesting on the fish stock and/or problems of congestion. Applications have, for example, been related to the discussion of closed areas as fisheries management tools. A multi-agent model of a fishery targeting different species in different areas was developed to analyze the implications of taking into account the response of fishing fleets to such regulatory controls. The model is based on the Cormas platform developed for the simulation of the dynamics of common resource systems. An advantage of the multi-agent approach is that it allows a greater degree of complexity than standard bio-economic modeling tools, by focusing on local, rather than global, interactions. Simulation results are presented to illustrate how the model can be used to analyze the consequences of regulatory measures such as temporary fishing bans on the allocation of fishing effort between target species and areas, and the ensuing economic impacts of these measures.},

However, there is a knowledge gap regarding how species that live associated with soft-substrates (e.g., sand, mud) respond to spatial protection. We analyzed abundance, biomass and total lengths of the soft-bottom fishes in a multiple-use MPA in the north-eastern Atlantic, the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (Portugal), during and after the implementation of its management plan. Data were collected by experimental fishing in areas with three different levels of protection, during the implementation period and for three years after full implementation of the MPA. Univariate analysis detected significant biomass increases between the two periods. Fish assemblages were mainly structured by depth and substrate, followed by protection level. Community composition analyses revealed significant differences between protection levels and between the two periods. Species exhibited a broad variation in their response to protection, and we hypothesize that factors such as species habitat preferences, body size and late maturity might be underlying determinants. Overall, this study provides some evidence of protection effectiveness in soft-bottom fish communities, supported by the significant increase in biomass in the protected areas and the positive trends of some species.},

A bottom-up nutritional limitation mechanism induced by physical oceanographic change or competition with fisheries was long thought to be largely responsible for these declines. The current weight of evidence is more consistent with top-down forcing. Increased predation by killer whales probably drove the sea otter collapse and may have been responsible for the earlier pinniped declines as well. We propose that decimation of the great whales by post-World War II industrial whaling caused the great whales' foremost natural predators, killer whales, to begin feeding more intensively on the smaller marine mammals, thus ``fishing-down'' this element of the marine food web. The timing of these events, information on the abundance, diet, and foraging behavior of both predators and prey, and feasibility analyses based on demographic and energetic modeling are all consistent with this hypothesis.},

Exclusive use or property rights may be based on catch, effort, or licenses, and similar systems can be used for bycatch. Unique issues arise compared to national systems. Two rights are entailed, access and catch/effort/capacity: Under international law, states hold the rights to fish and would receive the allocations. Individual states would distribute use rights to vessels, gear types or sectors. Systems for the creation and transferability of rights can accommodate diversity in national legal systems and issues and rights between coastal developing and small island states and distant water fishing nations. Allowing for those with a ""real interest"" and new entrants must be accommodated~under international law. Unique compliance and monitoring issues arise, including~rights based management instituted under self-enforcing multilateral cooperation in tuna-RFMOS and in accordance with international law, and trade an dport state measures, bans on transhipment, inclusion on IUU vessel lists. Rights-based management also helps break the deadlock facing RFMOs, since different management decisions implicitly differentially allocate opportunities, employment, assets, and benefits among member parties, and growing capacity~and delay accentuate the difficulty of governance reform and addressing root causes. After allocation, decentralized secondary markets replace on-going and contentious deliberations.},

Because RBM on catch or effort necessarily requires a total allowable catch (TAC) or total allowable effort (TAE), RBM is discussed in conjunction with issues in assessing fish populations and providing TACs or TAEs. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages, and there are trade-offs between the two approaches. In a narrow economic sense, catch rights are superior because of the type of incentives created, but once the costs of research to improve stock assessments and the associated risks of determining the TAC and costs of monitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement are taken into consideration, the choice between catch or effort RBM becomes more complex and less clear. The results will be case specific. Hybrid systems based on both catch and effort are increasingly employed to manage marine fisheries to capture the advantages of both approaches. In hybrid systems, catch or effort RBM dominates and controls on the other supplements. RBM using either catch or effort by itself addresses only the target species stock externality and not the remaining externalities associated with by-catch and the ecosystem.},

Here we describe the potential catch losses due to unsustainable fishing in all countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and on the high seas over 1950\textendash{}2004. To do so, we relied upon catch and price statistics from the Sea Around Us Project as well as an empirical relationship we derived from species stock assessments by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 2000 alone, estimated global catch losses amounted to 7\textendash{}36\% of the actual tonnage landed that year, resulting in a landed value loss of between 6.4and36billion(in2004constantUS6.4 and 36 billion (in 2004 constant US). From 1950\textendash{}2004, 36\textendash{}53\% of commercial species in 55\textendash{}66\% of EEZs may have been overfished. Referring to a species-level database of intrinsic vulnerability (V) based on life-history traits, it appears that susceptible species were depleted quickly and serially, with the average V of potential catch losses declining at a similar rate to that of actual landings. The three continental regions to incur greatest losses by mass were Europe, North America, and Asia\textemdash{}forming a geographic progression in time. But low-income and small island nations, heavily dependent on marine resources for protein, were impacted most profoundly. Our analysis shows that without the inexorable march of overfishing, \textasciitilde{}20 million people worldwide could have averted undernourishment in 2000. For the same year, total catch in the waters of low-income food deficit nations might have been up to 17\% greater than the tonnage actually landed there. The situation may be worst for Africa, which in our analysis registered losses of about 9\textendash{}49\% of its actual catches by mass in year 2000, thus seriously threatening progress towards the UN Millennium Development Goals.},

I demonstrate that combining diverse alternatives into a single outside option can result in distorted parameter estimates and misleading predictions. To evaluate the practical importance of how outside options are treated, I use data on the Florida spiny lobster and stone crab fisheries to compare a discrete choice model that explicitly accounts for individuals' ability to target both species with one that includes stone crab alternatives in the generic outside option. I find that parameter estimates and predictions for the lobster fishery depend heavily upon whether stone crab alternatives are explicitly accounted for. In addition, I conduct a series of Monte Carlo experiments, which demonstrate that the sign and magnitude of differences in predictions between models are complex functions of the characteristics of the empirical environment. Together, these results highlight the importance of carefully considering the composition of outside options when estimating discrete choice models and making predictions based on the estimates.},

Although recruitment variability has been extensively studied, somatic growth variation has received less attention, in part because of difficulties in modeling growth from individual size-at-age estimates. Here we develop a Bayesian state-space approach to test for the prevalence of alternative forms of growth rate variability (e.g., annual, cohort-level, or in the first year recruited to the fishery) in size-at-age data. We apply this technique to 29 Pacific groundfish species across the California Current, Gulf of Alaska, and Bering Sea \textendash{} Aleutian Islands marine ecosystems. About 40\% of modeled stocks were estimated to exhibit temporal growth variation. In the majority of stocks, growth trends fluctuated annually across ages in a single year, suggesting that either there are shared environmental features that dictate growth across multiple ages or the presence of some systematic (within-year) observation errors. This method represents a novel way to use size-at-age data from fishery or other sources to test hypotheses about growth dynamics variability.},

On average, DNA-identified species sold were less expensive (-2.98\% ex-vessel price) and more sustainable (+3.88\% IUCN status) than species listed on their label; thus, mislabeling had a net positive impact on the conservation status of sold species.

  abstract = {This paper describes a method for the analysis of groundfish survey data by incorporating zero and non-zero values into a single model. This is done by using a model which modifies the delta-distribution approach to fit into the GLM framework and uses maximum likelihood to estimate parameters. No prior assumptions of homogeneity are used for the structure of the zero or non-zero values. The method is primarily applicable to fixed-station designs, although extensions to other designs are possible. The maximum likelihood estimation reduces to fitting a GLM to 0/1 values and another GLM to the positive abundance values. The new model is tested on Icelandic groundfish survey data. It is seen that the model can be used for evaluating the effect of different factors on catch rates as well as estimating abundance indices. Results from different models are compared on the basis of tuned VPA runs.},

We simulated a hypothetical fishery loosely based on the Icelandic cod fishery, using a simple spatially explicit dynamic model. We compared the performance with respect to conserving the resource and economic return for each type of control measure alone and in combination. In general, combining more than one type of primary direct control on fishing provides a greater buffer to uncertainty than any single form of fishery control alone. Combining catch quota control with a large closed area is a most effective system for reducing the risk of stock collapse and maintaining both short and long\textendash{}term economic performance. Effort controls can also be improved by adding closed areas to the management scheme. We recommend that multiple control methods be used wherever possible and that closed areas should be used to buffer uncertainty. To be effective, these closed areas must be large and exclude all principal gears to provide real protection from fishing mortality.},

In this article, we discuss and compare the identifying assumptions of quasi-experiments using causal graphs. The increasing complexity of the causal graphs as one switches from an RCT to RD, IV, or PS designs reveals that the assumptions become stronger as the researcher's control over treatment selection diminishes. We introduce limiting graphs for the RD design and conditional graphs for the latent subgroups of com-pliers, always takers, and never takers of the IV design, and argue that the PS is a collider that offsets confounding bias via collider bias.},

  abstract = {The impact of fishing on chondrichthyan stocks around the world is currently the focus of considerable international concern. Most chondrichthyan populations are of low productivity relative to teleost fishes, a consequence of their different life-history strategies. This is reflected in the poor record of sustainability of target shark fisheries. Most sharks and some batoids are predators at, or near, the top of marine food webs. The effects of fishing are examined at the single-species level and through trophic interactions. We summarize the status of chondrichthyan fisheries from around the world. Some 50\% of the estimated global catch of chondrichthyans is taken as by-catch, does not appear in official fishery statistics, and is almost totally unmanaged. When taken as by-catch, they are often subjected to high fishing mortality directed at teleost target species. Consequently, some skates, sawfish, and deep-water dogfish have been virtually extirpated from large regions. Some chondrichthyans are more resilient to fishing and we examine predictions on the vulnerability of different species based on their life-history and population parameters. At the species level, fishing may alter size structure and population parameters in response to changes in species abundance. We review the evidence for such density-dependent change. Fishing can affect trophic interactions and we examine cases of apparent species replacement and shifts in community composition. Sharks and rays learn to associate trawlers with food and feeding on discards may increase their populations. Using ECOSIM, we make some predictions about the long-term response of ecosystems to fishing on sharks. Three different environments are analysed: a tropical shelf ecosystem in Venezuela, a Hawaiian coral reef ecosystem, and a North Pacific oceanic ecosystem.},

Although ecological effects of MPAs are well documented, their impacts on fishing communities and the spatial distribution of fishing effort remains elusive and poorly understood. In 1999, a MPA network was implemented to protect against perceived declines of reef fish harvested for the aquarium trade on the island of Hawaii. We investigated how the MPA network altered the spatial distribution of fishing effort and impacted perceived fisher socioeconomic well-being and fishing operations, as well as if the economic and catch benefits offset costs in the newly established non-MPA fishing areas. Data were collected using social surveys, experimental fishing, and catch reports. The results suggest the MPA network significantly displaced fishing effort from the central to the northern and southern coastal regions of the island farther from ports of entry. Estimated catch revenues and experimental catch per unit effort were statistically greater as distance from port of entry increased. Perceived fisher socioeconomic well-being was unaffected, but perceived fishing cost and travel time increased significantly post-MPA network implementation. Although the MPA network displaced fishing effort, fisher socioeconomic well-being was not compromised likely because they expanded their operating range and favorable market factors helped offset potential economic losses. Our findings are relevant because they help clarify how MPA networks alter spatial fishing behavior and impact the well-being of small-scale fishers.},

Although the area covered by MPAs is expanding, there is a concern that opposition from resource users is driving them into already low-use locations, whereas high-pressure areas remain unprotected, which has serious implications for biodiversity conservation. We tested the spatial relationships between different human-induced pressures on marine biodiversity and global MPAs. We used global, modeled pressure data and the World Database on Protected Areas to calculate the levels of 15 different human-induced pressures inside and outside the world's MPAs. We fitted binomial generalized linear models to the data to determine whether each pressure had a positive or negative effect on the likelihood of an area being protected and whether this effect changed with different categories of protection. Pelagic and artisanal fishing, shipping, and introductions of invasive species by ships had a negative relationship with protection, and this relationship persisted under even the least restrictive categories of protection (e.g., protected areas classified as category VI under the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a category that permits sustainable use). In contrast, pressures from dispersed, diffusive sources (e.g., pollution and ocean acidification) had positive relationships with protection. Our results showed that MPAs are systematically established in areas where there is low political opposition, limiting the capacity of existing MPAs to manage key drivers of biodiversity loss. We suggest that conservation efforts focus on biodiversity outcomes and effective reduction of pressures rather than prescribing area-based targets, and that alternative approaches to conservation are needed in areas where protection is not feasible.},

Applying this method to length-composition observations for 47 groundfish species collected during a standardized trawl survey, we found maximum realized sample size to be related to both the number of hauls and individual fish sampled from those hauls. Sampling in excess of 20 fish from each haul produced little increase in most cases, with maximum realized sample size ranging from approximately 2-4 per haul sampled.

  abstract = {Habitat loss, overexploitation, and numerous other stressors have caused global declines in apex predators. This ``trophic downgrading'' has generated widespread concern because of the fundamental role that apex predators can play in ecosystem functioning, disease regulation, and biodiversity maintenance. In attempts to combat declines, managers have conducted reintroductions, imposed stricter harvest regulations, and implemented protected areas. We suggest that full recovery of viable apex predator populations is currently the exception rather than the rule. We argue that, in addition to well-known considerations, such as continued exploitation and slow life histories, there are several underappreciated factors that complicate predator recoveries. These factors include three challenges. First, a priori identification of the suite of trophic interactions, such as resource limitation and competition that will influence recovery can be difficult. Second, defining and accomplishing predator recovery in the context of a dynamic ecosystem requires an appreciation of the timing of recovery, which can determine the relative density of apex predators and other predators and therefore affect competitive outcomes. Third, successful recovery programs require designing adaptive sequences of management strategies that embrace key environmental and species interactions as they emerge. Consideration of recent research on food web modules, alternative stable states, and community assembly offer important insights for predator recovery efforts and restoration ecology more generally. Foremost among these is the importance of a social-ecological perspective in facilitating a long-lasting predator restoration while avoiding unintended consequences. Variable life histories, species interactions, and historical contingency underlie why some predators recover and others do not.

  abstract = {The study of climate impacts on Living Marine Resources (LMRs) has increased rapidly in recent years with the availability of climate model simulations contributed to the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Collaboration between climate and LMR scientists and shared understanding of critical challenges for such applications are essential for developing robust projections of climate impacts on LMRs. This paper assesses present approaches for generating projections of climate impacts on LMRs using IPCC-class climate models, recommends practices that should be followed for these applications, and identifies priority developments that could improve current projections. Understanding of the climate system and its representation within climate models has progressed to a point where many climate model outputs can now be used effectively to make LMR projections. However, uncertainty in climate model projections (particularly biases and inter-model spread at regional to local scales), coarse climate model resolution, and the uncertainty and potential complexity of the mechanisms underlying the response of LMRs to climate limit the robustness and precision of LMR projections. A variety of techniques including the analysis of multi-model ensembles, bias corrections, and statistical and dynamical downscaling can ameliorate some limitations, though the assumptions underlying these approaches and the sensitivity of results to their application must be assessed for each application. Developments in LMR science that could improve current projections of climate impacts on LMRs include improved understanding of the multi-scale mechanisms that link climate and LMRs and better representations of these mechanisms within more holistic LMR models. These developments require a strong baseline of field and laboratory observations including long time series and measurements over the broad range of spatial and temporal scales over which LMRs and climate interact. Priority developments for IPCC-class climate models include improved model accuracy (particularly at regional and local scales), inter-annual to decadal-scale predictions, and the continued development of earth system models capable of simulating the evolution of both the physical climate system and biosphere. Efforts to address these issues should occur in parallel and be informed by the continued application of existing climate and LMR models.},

We consider the hypothesis that ecosystem-level variations in pelagic and benthic energy flows from phytoplankton to fish, trophic transfer efficiencies, and fishing effort can quantitatively reconcile this contrast in an energetically consistent manner. To test this hypothesis, we enlist global fish catch data that include previously neglected contributions from small-scale fisheries, a synthesis of global fishing effort, and plankton food web energy flux estimates from a prototype high-resolution global earth system model (ESM). After removing a small number of lightly fished ecosystems, stark interregional differences in fish catch per unit area can be explained (r = 0.79) with an energy-based model that (i) considers dynamic interregional differences in benthic and pelagic energy pathways connecting phytoplankton and fish, (ii) depresses trophic transfer efficiencies in the tropics and, less critically, (iii) associates elevated trophic transfer efficiencies with benthic-predominant systems. Model catch estimates are generally within a factor of 2 of values spanning two orders of magnitude. Climate change projections show that the same macroecological patterns explaining dramatic regional catch differences in the contemporary ocean amplify catch trends, producing changes that may exceed 50\% in some regions by the end of the 21st century under high-emissions scenarios. Models failing to resolve these trophodynamic patterns may significantly underestimate regional fisheries catch trends and hinder adaptation to climate change.},

Here we introduce MixSIAR, an inclusive, rich, and flexible Bayesian tracer (e.g., stable isotope) mixing model framework implemented as an open-source R package. Using MixSIAR as a foundation, we provide guidance for the implementation of mixing model analyses. We begin by outlining the practical differences between mixture data error structure formulations and relate these error structures to common mixing model study designs in ecology. Because Bayesian mixing models afford the option to specify informative priors on source proportion contributions, we outline methods for establishing prior distributions and discuss the influence of prior specification on model outputs. We also discuss the options available for source data inputs (raw data versus summary statistics) and provide guidance for combining sources. We then describe a key advantage of MixSIAR over previous mixing model software\textemdash{}the ability to include fixed and random effects as covariates explaining variability in mixture proportions and calculate relative support for multiple models via information criteria. We present a case study of Alligator mississippiensis diet partitioning to demonstrate the power of this approach. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of limitations to mixing model applications.

  abstract = {Mixing models are statistical tools that use biotracers to probabilistically estimate the contribution of multiple sources to a mixture. These biotracers may include contaminants, fatty acids, or stable isotopes, the latter of which are widely used in trophic ecology to estimate the mixed diet of consumers. Bayesian implementations of mixing models using stable isotopes (e.g., MixSIR, SIAR) are regularly used by ecologists for this purpose, but basic questions remain about when each is most appropriate. In this study, we describe the structural differences between common mixing model error formulations in terms of their assumptions about the predation process. We then introduce a new parameterization that unifies these mixing model error structures, as well as implicitly estimates the rate at which consumers sample from source populations (i.e., consumption rate). Using simulations and previously published mixing model datasets, we demonstrate that the new error parameterization outperforms existing models and provides an estimate of consumption. Our results suggest that the error structure introduced here will improve future mixing model estimates of animal diet.},

  abstract = {A spatially explicit population-dynamics model for the Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) in Exuma Sound, Bahamas, was used to investigate the joint effects of marine reserve design and larval dispersal via hydrodynamic currents on an exploited benthic invertebrate. The effects of three hydrodynamic scenarios (one diffusion-only and two advection-diffusion cases), one exploitation level, and 28 reserve configurations (7 sizes \texttimes{} 4 locations) on catch and larval production were simulated. The diffusion-only scenario represented the condition in which settlement did not vary substantially over broad spatial scales; in contrast, the advection-diffusion scenarios represented realistic hydrodynamic patterns and introduced broad spatial variation. Both advection-diffusion scenarios were based on empirical measurements of near-surface flow in Exuma Sound. Catches were sensitive to interactions between reserve configuration and pattern of larval dispersal. A given reserve configuration led to enhancement or decline in catch, depending on the hydrodynamic scenario, reserve size, and reserve location. Larval production increased linearly with reserve size, when size was expressed as the population fraction initially protected by the reserve, but when reserve size was expressed as the fraction of coastline protected, larval production decreased for some reserve configurations under the two advection-diffusion hydrodynamic scenarios. Use of a simple reserve-design rule (e.g., protect 20\% of a coast) would, in the latter cases, lead to a false sense of security, thereby endangering\textemdash{}not protecting\textemdash{}exploited stocks. The optimal design of marine reserves therefore requires attention to the joint effects of larval dispersal, reserve location, and reserve size on fishery yield and recruitment.},

Their ability to manage risk associated with such uncertainty and subsequently adapt to change is largely a function of individual circumstances, including their access to different fisheries. However, explicit attention to the heterogeneity of fishers' connections to fisheries at the level of the individual has been largely ignored. We illustrate the ubiquitous nature of these connections by constructing a typology of commercial fishers in the state of Maine based on the different fisheries that fishers rely on to sustain their livelihoods and find that there are over 600 combinations. We evaluate the adaptive potential of each strategy, using a set of attributes identified by fisheries experts in the state, and find that only 12\% of fishers can be classified as being well positioned to adapt in the face of changing socioeconomic and ecological conditions. Sensitivity to the uneven and heterogeneous capacity of fishers to manage risk and adapt to change is critical to devising effective management strategies that broadly support fishers. This will require greater attention to the social-ecological connectivity of fishers across different jurisdictions.},

For the normal linear model, fit under a log-transformation, correction factors are available to reduce this bias, but these factors may not be generally applicable to all model forms or other transformations. We demonstrate that this problem is handled in a straightforward manner using a Bayesian approach, which is general for linear and nonlinear models and other transformations and model error structures. The Bayesian framework provides a predictive distribution for the response variable so that inference can be made at the mean, or over the entire distribution to incorporate the predictive uncertainty.},

We tested the common perception that commercial and recreational fishing on inshore temperate reefs generate spatial impacts that diminish with distance from fisher access points. We collected data on harvested and non-harvested reef species using underwater visual censuses at 133 shallow rocky reef sites around Tasmania and tested for relationships between assemblage and species level indices of fishing impacts and distance to the nearest boat launching ramp. Slopes of size spectra of fish communities tended to decrease with distance from the nearest boat ramp, with this relationship apparently resulting from low numbers of large fish (\&gt; 30~cm TL) and a greater number of smaller fish (\&lt; 15~cm TL) at sites closest to access points. At the species level, relationships were evident either in the abundance of legal individuals or the mean size of harvested species with distance to the nearest boat ramp, except for rock lobster. Patterns for rock lobster differed when areas in which commercial or recreational fisheries dominated were considered separately from the statewide analysis. A pattern of increasing numbers of legal lobsters with increasing distance from boat ramps was observed, but only in the areas in which the recreational fishery dominated. Observed relationships in all species were consistent with greater fishing impacts at sites closest to boat ramps, with the exception of exploited wrasses. Banded morwong, which are subject to a live export fishery, appeared to be most affected by proximity to boat ramps. Conversely, no relationships were found between the abundance or size of the most frequently occurring non-harvested species and distance to boat ramps.

These results support the hypothesis that greater fishing impacts occur at more accessible sites over the entire Tasmanian coastline. The variability of results among individual species are likely, at least in part, to be related to differences in fisheries characteristics such as vessel size and range, as well as the suitability of our methods for detecting impacts. The potential of such a pattern in fishing impacts to be evident in other locations will thus likely depend on characteristics of the particular fishes and fisheries.},

Understanding the livelihoods of coastal communities is important for devising relevant and effective fisheries management strategies. Semi-structured household interviews were conducted with householders in Langalanga Lagoon, Solomon Islands, to understand household livelihoods and resource governance in fishing-dependent communities. Households were engaged in a diverse range of livelihoods. Fishing, shell money production and gardening were the most important livelihoods. Proximity to an urban centre influenced how households accessed some livelihoods. Perceptions of management rules varied and different reasons were cited for why rules were broken, the most common reason being to meet livelihood needs. Current models of inshore small-scale fisheries management that are based on the notion of community-based resource management may not work in locations where customary management systems are weak and livelihoods are heavily reliant on marine resources. An important step for fisheries management in such locations should include elucidating community priorities through participatory development planning, taking into consideration livelihoods as well as governance and development aspirations.},

For instance, models of straddling stocks are yet to be fully developed.

What bio-economic benefits can be expected from the implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) in a fishery facing a shock in the form of recruitment failure, and managed jointly compared to separately? What are the optimal sizes of MPAs under cooperation and non-cooperation? I explore these questions in the current paper by developing a computational two-agent model, which incorporates MPAs using the North East Atlantic codfishery as an example. Results from the study indicate that MPAs can protect the discounted economic rent from the fishery if the habitat is likely to face a shock, andfishers have a high discount rate. The total standing biomass increases with increasing MPA size but only up to a point. Basedon the specifics of the model, the study also shows that the economically optimal size of MPA for cod varies between 50 70\% depending on (i) the exchange rate between the protectedandunprotectedareas of the habitat; (ii) whether fishers behalf cooperatively or non-cooperatively; and(iii) the severity of the shock that the ecosystem may face.},

The basis for this claim is that MEY considers only the `catching' of fish and that when the full value-chain is considered; it is the MSY level that maximizes economic value. We argue that to maximize society's benefit from a given sector of an economy, resources need to be allocated across all sectors such that additional net benefits from employing one more unit of society's resources are equalized across all sectors of the economy. In this way, the opportunity cost of employing society's resources across all economic sectors is minimized. In an economy where all resources are fully utilized, further value added in the value chain for fish is an additional cost and has the effect of reducing fishing effort and optimum yield rather than the opposite. In a less developed economy or a developed one in recession where all resources are not fully used, the multiplier effect could be important, and if it is high for fisheries it would be an argument to maximize sustainable yield and effort. We show, using current input-output data, that this is not the case. Furthermore, from a simple principle of optimization, we know that to optimize a sector that consists of many segments through time, one has to optimize every portion of the chain through time.},

  abstract = {The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) developed a zoning plan as part of its overall management plan, fully implemented as of 1997. The plan created several closed areas or harvest refugia in which consumptive activities are prohibited. This research reports results of surveys that we conducted with members of three stakeholder groups in the Florida Keys: commercial fishers, dive operators, and members of local environmental groups. Surveys requested responses regarding the information sources individuals tapped when learning of the zoning plan and the FKNMS; their degree of public participation; their perceptions and acceptance of the zoning strategy and the process of its design; and the expected outcomes of the zoning strategy. Many responses show significant differences among the three groups. Fishers felt highly alienated from the process of zone designation and displayed a sense of anger and powerlessness with respect to what they considered to be an attempt to exclude their group from the harvest refugia. Dive operators demonstrated the highest levels of participation in the designation process, but were concerned that refugia regulations could limit their activities in the future. Members of environmental groups were the strongest supporters of the harvest refugia concept and the FKNMS. This research suggests numerous ways in which marine resource managers could improve their public outreach and information dissemination strategies when developing future harvest refugia and marine protected areas.},

Changes in prices alter economic incentives by affecting revenues, profits, conservation, and nonmarket public benefits. Economic incentives in industries exploiting common resources have been examined from multiple angles. However, industry level variation in market prices arising from changes in public regulation has not been explored. We analyse the impact on economic incentives due to changes in output limits and market prices through estimation of ex-vessel price and scale flexibilities for imported skipjack and yellowfin in Thailand's cannery market. The unitary scale flexibility, estimated from the General Synthetic Inverse Demand Systems, indicates no loss in revenue and even potential profit increases resulting from lower harvest levels that could arise from lower catch limits. However, for a revenue neutral or positive outcome to be achieved, the three inter-governmental tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, which manage the majority of the yellowfin and skipjack tuna in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, would have to coordinate multilaterally to set the catch limits for both species.},

Using historical data on marine species, we show that the year-to-year fluctuations of population growth rate obey a well-defined double-exponential (Laplace) distribution. This striking regularity allows us to devise a stochastic model despite seemingly irregular variations in population abundances. The model identifies the effect of reduced growth at low population density as a key factor missed in current approaches of population variability analysis and without which extinction risks are severely underestimated. The model also allows us to separate the effect of demographic stochasticity and show that single-species growth rates are dominantly determined by stochasticity common to all species. This dominance\textemdash{}and the implications it has for interspecies correlations, including co-extinctions\textemdash{}emphasizes the need for ecosystem-level management approaches to reduce the extinction risk of the individual species themselves.},

Agricultural ecosystems rely on a suite of supporting ecosystem services to provide food, fiber and fuel as well as a range of accompanying but non-marketed ecosystem services (ES). Ecosystem services from agriculture include regulation of water and climate systems, aesthetic and cultural services, as well as enhanced supporting services (such as soil fertility). Many of these ES are appreciated by people, but they lack markets, so they lack the incentives for provision that come with prices. For public policy decisions to take them into account, non-market valuation techniques are needed, such as travel cost, contingent valuation, hedonic valuation, and cost-based or factor-income approaches. This article offers an overview of ES from agriculture and non-market valuation methods as it introduces the articles in this special section on ``Ecosystem Services and Agriculture.'' Understanding how ecological functions generate ES is fundamental to management, but so too is understanding how humans perceive and value those services. Research is required both to design cost-effective incentives to provide ES and to measure which kinds of ES could provide the greatest overall welfare benefits to society. Agricultural ecosystems offer newly recognized potential to deliver more diverse ecosystem services and mitigate the level of past ecosystem disservices. This special section of Ecological Economics conveys both how these are becoming possible and the challenges to science and public policy design of turning that potential into reality.},

Collaboration, it is argued, is imperative for solving these problems. Understanding how collaboration is occurring in practice is important, however, and may help explain the idea space across a field. In an effort to make sense of the shape of fisheries science, here we construct a co-authorship network of the field, from a data set comprising 73,240 scientific articles, drawn from 50 journals and published between 2000 and 2017. Using a combination of social network analysis and machine learning, the work first maps the global structure of scientific collaboration amongst fisheries scientists at the author, country and institutional levels. Second, it uncovers the hidden subgroups\textemdash{}here country clusters and communities of authors\textemdash{}within the network, detailing also the topical focus, publication outlets and relative impact of the largest fisheries science communities. We find that whilst the fisheries science network is becoming more geographically extensive, it is simultaneously becoming more intensive. The uncovered network exhibits characteristics suggestive of a thin style of collaboration, and groupings that are more regional than they are global. Although likely shaped by an array of overlapping micro- and macro-level factors, the analysis reveals a number of political\textendash{}economic patterns that merit reflection by both fisheries scientists and policymakers.},

A key component of the rebuilding plan for snow crab was the stock assessment on which management advice was based. In common with all stock assessments, there are numerous potential sources of uncertainty, but it is not clear which uncertainty is most influential, and hence how research should be focused to best reduce uncertainty. A simulation framework is used to explore the estimation ability of the assessment method when its assumptions are violated. The focus of this evaluation is on how well management quantities such as mature male biomass and the overfishing level can be estimated. Three categories of uncertainty are considered: mis-specification of pre-specified parameters, data quantity and/or quality, and assumptions in the assessment related to fishing mortality. Management quantities are estimated reasonably well when all assumptions of the stock assessment method are correct. Additional data on growth and natural mortality would be most beneficial. However, penalties on fishing mortality introduce bias into estimates, and survey selectivity patterns are poorly determined by the estimation method.},

Regime shifts are a prominent feature of the physical environment of some ecosystems and have the potential to influence stock productivity. However, few management strategies or harvest control rules (HCRs) consider the possibility of changes in stock productivity. A management strategy evaluation is conducted for the snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) fishery in the eastern Bering Sea, an ecosystem influenced by regime shifts. Operating models that project recruitment as a single average (i.e. the current basis for management advice), regime-based with no relationship between recruitment and spawning biomass, and regime-based with control of recruitment oscillating between environmental conditions and spawning biomass are considered. An HCR that accounts for shifts in recruitment regime is compared with the status quo HCR for each operating model. The regime-based HCR increases yield and decreases variability in yield at the cost of a higher probability of overfishing in regime-based systems. However, the regime-based HCR slightly decreases yield (no change in variability) and increases the probability of overfishing in non-regime-based systems. Identifying changes in productivity that are definitely driven by environmental regime rather than fishing pressure is the largest difficulty in implementing these rules.},

Fisheries scientists often assume the number of young fish entering a population (recruitment) is related to the biomass of spawning adults and that recruitment dynamics do not change over time. Thus, managers often use a target biomass based on spawning biomass as the basis for calculating sustainable catches. However, we show recruitment and spawning biomass are not positively related over the observed range of stock sizes for 61\% of 224 stocks in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database. Furthermore, 85\% of stocks for which spawning biomass may not drive recruitment dynamics over the observed ranges exhibit shifts in average recruitment, which is often used in proxies for target biomasses. Our results suggest that the environment more strongly influences recruitment than spawning biomass over the observed stock sizes for many stocks. Management often endeavours to maintain stock sizes within the observed ranges, so methods for setting management targets that include changes within an ecosystem may better define the status of some stocks, particularly as climate changes.},

More intense fishing necessarily results in fewer fish; however, the higher exploitation rates commonly seen as forage fish biomass declines do not always mean that fishing precipitated collapses in productivity.

However, conservation concerns have been raised given signs of over-exploitation observed during the mid-2000s, including decreasing trends in catch per unit effort (CPUE), yield, and profitability. We developed an integrated, size-structured assessment method to estimate trends in fishing mortality, recruitment, and mature biomass. A posterior distribution of spawning potential ratio (SPR) in 2011 was calculated using Bayesian methods and had a median of 44\%, which is higher than most commonly used reference points (e.g. SPR = 40\%). However, there are uncertainties in our estimates and continued monitoring with standardized data collection protocols should be a priority for future work in this fishery. Management should work toward establishing science-based management strategies that consider both the needs of fishing communities and the imperative to conserve unique ecosystems such as the Galapagos Islands.},

We show that reported catches can be approximated using an ecosystem model that allows for trophic cascades (i.e., the depletion of predators and consequent increases in production of their prey).

We project that fishing practices could be modified to increase total catches, revenue, and biomass in the East China Sea, but single-species management would decrease both catches and revenue by reversing the trophic cascades. Our results suggest that implementing single-species management in currently lightly managed and highly exploited multispecies fisheries (which account for a large fraction of global fish catch) may result in decreases in global catch. Efforts to reform management in these fisheries will need to consider system wide impacts of changes in management, rather than focusing only on individual species.},

  abstract = {Fisheries dynamics can be thought of as the reciprocal relationship between an exploited population and the fishers and/or managers determining the exploitation patterns. Sustainable production of protein of these coupled human-natural systems requires an understanding of their dynamics. Here, we characterized the fishery dynamics for 173 fisheries from around the globe by applying general additive models to estimated fishing mortality and spawning biomass from the RAM Legacy Database. GAMs specified to mimic production models and more flexible GAMs were applied. We show observed dynamics do not always match assumptions made in management using ``classical'' fisheries models, and the suitability of these assumptions varies significantly according to large marine ecosystem, habitat, variability in recruitment, maximum weight of a species and minimum observed stock biomass. These results identify circumstances in which simple models may be useful for management. However, adding flexibility to classical models often did not substantially improve performance, which suggests in many cases considering only biomass and removals will not be sufficient to model fishery dynamics. Knowledge of the suitability of common assumptions in management should be used in selecting modelling frameworks, setting management targets, testing management strategies and developing tools to manage data-limited fisheries. Effectively balancing expectations of future protein production from capture fisheries and risk of undesirable outcomes (e.g., ``fisheries collapse'') depends on understanding how well we can expect to predict future dynamics of a fishery using current management paradigms.},

Commonly voiced concerns include complicated and expensive implementation, prohibitive data requirements, and lack of testing with long-term applications. We address some of these perceived barriers by providing guidance on strategies and approaches that can be used for the steps of one ecosystem-based management process, the integrated ecosystem assessment framework, including scoping, defining indicators, setting thresholds, risk analysis, management strategy evaluation, monitoring and evaluation. Importantly, we demonstrate how an ecosystem-based management approach can be utilized in a variety of contexts which vary widely in data quality and availability, governance structure, and time frame. We then illustrate the suggested steps in the process by exploring two case studies that represent realistic ends of the data/governance/time frame spectrum: Puget Sound, Washington, USA and Raja Ampat, Indonesia. By providing concrete suggestions for how to move forward with key steps in an integrated management process, we show that ecosystem-based management is feasible from a range of starting points and that for any given starting point there are numerous productive paths forward.},

In the new United States ocean policy, and several other cases around the globe, ecosystem services are at the core of marine spatial planning, but there is little guidance on how ecosystem services should be measured, making it hard to implement this new approach. A new framework is shown here for practical, rigorous ecosystem service measurement that highlights contributions from both natural and social systems. The novel three-step framework addresses traditional shortcomings of an ecosystem services approach by giving managers and scientists the tools to assess and track: (1) the condition of the ecosystem (supply metrics), (2) the amount of ocean resources actually used or enjoyed by people (service metrics), and (3) people's preference for that level of service (value metrics). This framework will allow real world progress on marine spatial planning to happen quickly, and with a greater chance for success.},

Stock Synthesis allows the normal distribution of length-at-age to be partitioned into three or five overlapping platoons with slow, medium, or fast growth trajectories. The platoons are tracked separately in the model, and experience different degrees of size-selective fishing pressure and mortality, but are assumed to be unobservable except through changes in the length distribution. Simulations are used to explore this phenomenon in conjunction with dome-shaped selectivity, an alternative explanation for observing fewer than expected large fish in sampled data, but with very different implications for population productivity. For data simulated both with and without platoons, misspecification of the assumptions about growth are found to bias model results, with selectivity often incorrectly identified as the cause of fewer observations of larger fish. Trends in dome-shaped selectivity were explored as a potential diagnostic of model misspecification.},

General lack of data and uncertainty about the level of employment in marine fisheries can lead to underestimation of fishing effort and hence over-exploited fisheries, or result in inaccurate projections of economic and societal costs and benefits. To address this gap, a database of marine fisheries employment for 144 coastal nations was compiled. Gaps in employment data that emerged were filled using a Monte Carlo approach to estimate the number of direct and indirect fisheries jobs. We focused on estimating jobs in the small-scale fishing sector. We characterized small-scale fishing as (i) primarily geared towards household consumption or sale at the local level; (ii) conducted at a low level of economic activity; (iii) minimally mechanized; (iv) conducted within inshore areas; (v) minimally managed; and/or (vi) undertaken for cultural or ceremonial purposes. In total, we estimated that 260~{$\pm{}~$}6~million people are involved in global marine fisheries, encompassing full-time and part-time jobs in the direct and indirect sectors, with 22~{$\pm{}~$}0.45~million of those being small-scale fishers. This is equivalent to 203~{$\pm{}~$}34~million full-time equivalent jobs.

Many reef fisheries worldwide are open access, and fishers under open access systems are theorized to discount the future at an infinite rate. In contrast, fishers in a customary managed fishery can be expected to be more long term oriented, and thus possibly have lower discount rates. The present study tests this hypothesis by eliciting the discount rates of fishers in an open access small-scale reef fishery, and compares these rates to those of fishers in a customary managed reef fishery. Results indicate that fishers in both open access and traditionally managed reef fisheries have high annual discount rates that are on average over 200\%. Contrary to expectations, fishers under an open access system are not associated with higher discount rates compared to customary management. It also appears that a larger proportion of open access fishers are more long-term oriented than those in the customary managed fishery, which is encouraging for the future conservation and sustainability of open access fisheries resources.},

The focus of this study was two-fold, to: (1) assess how the impact of Degree-Heating-Month (DHM) thermal stress threshold choice affects potential bleaching predictions and (2) examine the effect of hypothetical adaptation rates of corals to rising temperature. DHM values were estimated using a conventional threshold of 1\textdegree{}C and a variability-based threshold of 2{$\sigma$} above the climatological maximum Coral adaptation rates were simulated as a function of historical 100-year exposure to maximum annual SSTs with a dynamic rather than static climatological maximum based on the previous 100 years, for a given reef cell. Within CCSM3 simulations, the 1\textdegree{}C threshold predicted later onset of mild bleaching every 5 years for the fraction of reef grid cells where 1\textdegree{}C {$>$} 2{$\sigma$} of the climatology time series of annual SST maxima (1961\textendash{}1990). Alternatively, DHM values using both thresholds, with CSIRO MK 3.5 and GFDL CM 2.1 SSTs, did not produce drastically different onset timing for bleaching every 5 years. Across models, DHMs based on 1\textdegree{}C thermal stress threshold show the most threatened reefs by 2100 could be in the Central and Western Equatorial Pacific, whereas use of the variability-based threshold for DHMs yields the Coral Triangle and parts of Micronesia and Melanesia as bleaching hotspots. Simulations that allow corals to adapt to increases in maximum SST drastically reduce the rates of bleaching. These findings highlight the importance of considering the thermal stress threshold in DHM estimates as well as potential adaptation models in future coral bleaching projections.},

  abstract = {This paper examines variations in social acceptability of a Marine Protected Area (MPA) prior to implementation. The influence of a number of factors, including socio-economic characteristics, perception of coral resources state of health and attitudes towards non-compliance with regulations are analysed. During May 2006, 640 questionnaires were distributed to school children around Reunion Island, Western Indian Ocean, for completion by their parents, following an informal educational activity made in school. From a 73\% (n~=~469) response rate, results showed that 78\% of participants were in favour of the MPA. Analysis further identified that those supportive of the MPA were generally from higher socio-professional categories, had a negative perception of the coral reef ecosystem's health and were not originally from Reunion. In contrast, locals (born in Reunion) from lower socio-professional categories or with no employment activity and having a positive perception of the health status of coral reefs offered no opinion on the MPA. Attitudes towards enforcement and compliance highlighted that SCUBA divers, fishers and jet skiers attributed a higher value to the protection of the coral reef environment through enforcement of MPA regulations than to their own use of the coral reef resource. When asked about the use of penalties to deter non-compliance, swimmers were awarded the lowest fines, followed by SCUBA divers, fishers then jet skiers being awarded the highest fines. Thus, the more severe the act of non-compliance by a resource user group was perceived to be, the more these users themselves disapproved of non-compliant behaviour and supported use of high penalties. The survey design through focusing on school children's parents, demonstrated a simple and cost-effective method for data collection while providing environmental education, which could be employed in similar case studies elsewhere.},

In response to dramatic declines of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) in southern California by the late 1990s two large MPAs, the Cowcod Conservation Areas (CCAs), were established in 2001. To evaluate whether the CCAs affected rockfish productivity we evaluated the dynamics of 8 species that were, and 7 that were not, historically targeted by fishing. Abundances of 6/8 targeted and 4/7 non-targeted species increased regionally from 1998 to 2013. These upturns were probably affected by environmental conditions in addition to changes in fishing pressure as the presence of most species correlated negatively with temperature, and temperature was lower than the historic average in 11/15 years. Seventy-five per cent of the targeted, but none of the non-targeted species increased at a greater rate inside than outside the CCAs while controlling for environmental factors. Results indicate that management actions, coupled with favourable environmental conditions, facilitated the resurgence of multiple rockfish species that were targeted by intense fishing effort for decades.},

  abstract = {Multispecies mixed fisheries catch ecologically interacting species with the same gears at the same time. We used an ensemble of size-based multispecies models to investigate the effects of different rates of fishing mortality (F) and fleet configurations on yield, biomass, risk of collapse and community structure. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and FMSY for 21 modelled species' populations in the North Sea were defined at the Nash equilibrium, where any independent change in F for any species would not increase that species' MSY. Fishing mortality ranges leading to ``Pretty Good Yield'' (F-PGY), by species, were defined as ranges yielding\,{$\geq$}0.95\,\texttimes\,MSY. Weight and value of yield from the entire fishery increased marginally when all species were fished at the upper end of F-PGY ranges rather than at FMSY, but risk of species' collapse and missing community targets also increased substantially. All risks fell markedly when fishing at the lower end of F-PGY ranges, but with small impacts on total fishery yield or value. While fishing anywhere within F-PGY ranges gives managers flexibility to manage trade-offs in multispecies mixed fisheries, our results suggest high long-term yields and disproportionately lower risks of stock collapse are achieved when F\,{$\leq$}\,FMSY for all component stocks.},

  abstract = {Forecasting distribution shifts under novel environmental conditions is a major task for ecologists and conservationists. Researchers forecast distribution shifts using several tools including: predicting from an empirical relationship between a summary of distribution (population centroid) and annual time series (``annual regression,'' AR); or fitting a habitat-envelope model to historical distribution and forecasting given predictions of future environmental conditions (``habitat envelope,'' HE). However, surprisingly little research has estimated forecast skill by fitting to historical data, forecasting distribution shifts and comparing forecasts with subsequent observations of distribution shifts. I demonstrate the important role of retrospective skill testing by forecasting poleward movement over 1-, 2- or 3-year periods for 20 fish and crab species in the Eastern Bering Sea and comparing forecasts with observed shifts. I specifically introduce an alternative vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) forecasting model, which can include species temperature responses, and compare skill for AR, HE and VAST forecasts. Results show that the HE forecast has 30\%\textendash{}43\% greater variance than predicting that future distribution is identical to the estimated distribution in the final year (a ``persistence'' forecast). Meanwhile, the AR explains 2\%\textendash{}6\% and VAST explains 8\%\textendash{}25\% of variance in poleward movement, and both have better performance than a persistence forecast. HE and AR both generate forecast intervals that are too narrow, while VAST models with or without temperature have appropriate width for forecast intervals. Retrospective skill testing for more regions and taxa should be used as a test bed to guide future improvements in methods for forecasting distribution shifts.},

  abstract = {Scientific survey data are used to estimate abundance trends for fish populations worldwide, and are frequently analyzed using delta-generalized linear mixed models (delta-GLMMs). Delta-GLMMs incorporate information about both the probability of catch being non-zero (catch probability) and the expected value for non-zero catches (catch rates). Delta-GLMMs generally incorporate year as a main effect, and frequently account for spatial strata and/or covariates. Many existing delta-GLMMs do not account for random or systematic differences in catch probability or rates in particular combinations of spatial strata and year (i.e., space\textendash{}time interactions), and do not recognize potential correlation in random space\textendash{}time interactions between catch probability and catch rates. We therefore develop a Bayesian delta-GLMM that estimates correlations between catch probability and rates, and compare it with either (a) ignoring year\textendash{}strata interactions, (b) modeling year\textendash{}strata interactions as fixed effects, or (c) estimating year\textendash{}strata interactions in catch probability or rates as independent random effects. These four models are fitted to bottom trawl survey data for 28 species off the U.S. West Coast. The posterior median of the correlation is positive for the majority (18) of species, including all five for which the posterior distribution has little overlap with zero. However, estimating this correlation has little impact on resulting abundance indices or credible intervals. We therefore conclude that the correlated random model will have a little impact on index standardization of the West Coast bottom trawl dataset. However, we propose that the correlated model can quickly identify correlations between occupancy probability and density, and provide our code to allow researchers to quickly identify whether such a correlation is likely to be significantly different from zero for their chosen data set.},

  abstract = {Correlations among life history parameters have been discussed in the ecological literature for over 50 years, but are often estimated while treating model estimates of demographic rates such as natural mortality (M) or individual growth (k) as ``data.'' This approach fails to propagate uncertainty appropriately because it ignores correlations in estimation errors between parameters within a species and differences in estimation error among species. An improved alternative is multi-species mixed-effects modeling, which we approximate using multivariate likelihood profiles in an approach that synthesizes information from several population dynamics models. Simulation modeling demonstrates that this approach has minimal bias, and that precision improves with increased number of species. As a case study, we demonstrate this approach by estimating M/k for 11 groundfish species off the U.S. West Coast using the data and functional forms on which pre-existing, peer-reviewed, population dynamics models are based. M/k is estimated to be 1.26 for Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), with a coefficient of variation of 76\% for M given k. This represents the first-ever estimate of correlations among life history parameters for marine fishes using several age-structured population dynamics models, and it serves as a standard for future life history correlation studies. This approach can be modified to provide robust estimates of other life history parameters and correlations, and requires few changes to existing population dynamics models and software input files for both marine and terrestrial species. Specific results for Pacific rockfishes can be used as a Bayesian prior for estimating natural mortality in future fisheries management efforts. We therefore recommend that fish population dynamics models be compiled in a global database that can be used to simultaneously analyze observation-level data for many species in life history meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {Interpretation of fishery-dependent and independent-survey data requires accounting for changes in the proportion of local individuals that are caught by fishing gear (``catchability''). Catchability may be influenced by measured characteristics of fishing gear, and even standardized fishing techniques may experience changing catchability over time due to changes in fishing vessel characteristics and personnel. The importance of vessel power has long been recognized in the analysis of fishery dependent catch per unit effort data, but less-studied in the analysis of fishery independent data collected by research vessel surveys. Here we demonstrate how differences in catchability among vessels (``vessel effects''), as well as random variation in vessel-specific catchability over time (``vessel-year effects'') can be incorporated into generalized linear mixed models through their treatment as random effects. We apply these methods to data for 28 groundfish species caught in a standardized survey using contracted fishery vessels and personnel in the Northeast Pacific. Model selection shows that vessel, vessel-year, and both effects simultaneously are supported by available data for at least a few species. However, vessel-year effects generally have a larger effect on catch rates than vessel-effects and hence abundance indices estimated using both vessel- and vessel-year effects are generally similar to estimates when using just vessel-year effects. Additionally, models indicate little support for the hypothesis that characteristics such as length and displacement of the contracted vessels used in this survey have a substantial impact on catch rates. Finally, inclusion of vessel- or vessel-year effects generally results in wider estimates of credible intervals for resulting indices of abundance. This increased credible interval width is consistent with statistical theory, because vessel effects will result in non-independence of different sampling occasions, thus decreasing effective sample sizes. For this reason, we advocate that future analyses include vessel- and/or vessel-year effects when standardizing survey data from cooperative research programs.},

Autocorrelated recruitment will occur whenever average recruitment levels change between oceanographic regimes or due to predator release, but may also indicate persistent environmental and biological effects on shorter time-scales. Here, we use estimates of recruitment variability and autocorrelation to simulate the stationary distribution of spawning biomass for 100 real-world stocks when unfished, fished at FMSY, or fished following a harvest control rule where fishing mortality decreases as a function of spawning biomass. Results show that unfished stocks have spawning biomass (SB) below its deterministic equilibrium value (SB0) 58\% of the time, and below 0.5SB0 5\% of the time on average across all stocks. Similarly, stocks fished at the level producing deterministic maximum sustainable yield (FMSY) are below its deterministic prediction of spawning biomass (SBMSY) 60\% of the time and below 0.5SBMSY 8\% of the time. These probabilities are greater for stocks with high recruitment variability, positive autocorrelation, and high natural mortality\textemdash{}traits that are particularly associated with clupeids and scombrids. An elevated probability of stochastic depletion, i.e. biomass below the deterministic equilibrium expectation, implies that management actions required when biomass drops below a threshold may be triggered more frequently than expected.

However, the generality of this conclusion is currently unknown because geostatistical models are computationally challenging to simulation-test and have not previously been evaluated using multiple species. We develop a new maximum likelihood estimator for geostatistical index standardization, which uses recent improvements in estimation for Gaussian random fields. We apply the model to data for 28 groundfish species off the U.S. West Coast and compare results to a previous ``stratified'' index standardization model, which accounts for spatial variation using post-stratification of available data. This demonstrates that the stratified model generates a relative index with 60\% larger estimation intervals than the geostatistical model. We also apply both models to simulated data and demonstrate (i) that the geostatistical model has well-calibrated confidence intervals (they include the true value at approximately the nominal rate), (ii) that neither model on average under- or overestimates changes in abundance, and (iii) that the geostatistical model has on average 20\% lower estimation errors than a stratified model. We therefore conclude that the geostatistical model uses survey data more efficiently than the stratified model, and therefore provides a more cost-efficient treatment for historical and ongoing fish sampling data.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis has been an integral tool for fisheries researchers since the late 1990s. However, there remain few guidelines for the design, implementation or interpretation of meta-analyses in the field of fisheries. Here, we provide the necessary background for readers, authors and reviewers, including a brief history of the use of meta-analysis in fisheries, an overview of common model types and distinctions, and examples of different goals that can be achieved using meta-analysis. We outline the primary challenges in implementing meta-analyses, including difficulties in discriminating between alternative hypotheses that can explain the data with equal plausibility, the importance of validating results using multiple lines of evidence, the trade-off between complexity and sample size and problems associated with the use of model output. For each of these challenges, we also provide suggestions, such as the use of propensity scores for dealing with selection bias and the use of covariates to control for confounding effects. These challenges are then illustrated with examples from diverse subfields of fisheries, including (i) the analysis of the stock\textendash{}recruit relationship, (ii) fisheries management, rebuilding and population viability, (iii) habitat-specific vital rates, (iv) life-history theory and (v) the evaluation of marine reserves. We conclude with our reasons for believing that meta-analysis will continue to grow in importance for these and many other research goals in fisheries science and argue that standards of practice are therefore essential.},

Many sub-fields use observational or experimental data to make inference about biological characteristics that are not directly observed (called ``latent states''), such as heritability of phenotypic traits, habitat suitability, and population densities to name a few. Latent states will generally cause model residuals to be correlated, violating the assumption of statistical independence made in many statistical modelling approaches. In this exposition, we argue that mixed-effect modelling (i) is an important and generic solution to non-independence caused by latent states; (ii) provides a unifying framework for disparate statistical methods such as time-series, spatial, and individual-based models; and (iii) is increasingly practical to implement and customize for problem-specific models. We proceed by summarizing the distinctions between fixed and random effects, reviewing a generic approach for parameter estimation, and distinguishing general categories of non-linear mixed-effect models. We then provide four worked examples, including state-space, spatial, individual-level variability, and quantitative genetics applications (with working code for each), while providing comparison with conventional fixed-effect implementations. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research in this important framework for modelling and statistical analysis in fisheries biology.},

Species distributions can be estimated using geostatistical methods, which estimate a latent spatial variable explaining observed variation in densities, but geostatistical methods may be imprecise for species with low densities or few observations. Additionally, simple geostatistical methods fail to account for correlations in distribution among species and generally estimate such cross-correlations as a post hoc exercise.

* We therefore present spatial factor analysis (SFA), a spatial model for estimating a low-rank approximation to multivariate data, and use it to jointly estimate the distribution of multiple species simultaneously. We also derive an analytic estimate of cross-correlations among species from SFA parameters.

* As a first example, we show that distributions for 10 bird species in the breeding bird survey in 2012 can be parsimoniously represented using only five spatial factors. As a second case study, we show that forward prediction of catches for 20 rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the U.S. West Coast is more accurate using SFA than analysing each species individually. Finally, we show that single-species models give a different picture of cross-correlations than joint estimation using SFA.

* Spatial factor analysis complements a growing list of tools for jointly modelling the distribution of multiple species and provides a parsimonious summary of cross-correlation without requiring explicit declaration of habitat variables. We conclude by proposing future research that would model species cross-correlations using dissimilarity of species' traits, and the development of spatial dynamic factor analysis for a low-rank approximation to spatial time-series data.},

Ecologists have aimed to estimate density dependence in population and community data by fitting a simple autoregressive (Gompertz) model for density dependence to time series of abundance for an entire population. However, it is increasingly recognized that spatial heterogeneity in population densities has implications for population and community dynamics. We therefore adapt the Gompertz model to approximate local densities over continuous space instead of population-wide abundance, and allow productivity to vary spatially using Gaussian random fields. We then show that the conventional (nonspatial) Gompertz model can result in biased estimates of density dependence (e.g., identifying oscillatory dynamics when not present) if densities vary spatially. By contrast, the spatial Gompertz model provides accurate and precise estimates of density dependence for a variety of simulation scenarios and data availabilities. These results are corroborated when comparing spatial and nonspatial models for data from 10 years and \textasciitilde{}100 sampling stations for three long-lived rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) off the California, USA coast. In this case, the nonspatial model estimates implausible oscillatory dynamics on an annual time scale, while the spatial model estimates strong autocorrelation and is supported by model selection tools. We conclude by discussing the importance of improved data archiving techniques, so that spatial models can be used to reexamine classic questions regarding the existence and magnitude of density dependence in wild populations.},

We therefore use a life table (based on age-structured assessment models) to explore the sensitivity of fishing mortality, spawning biomass, and catch targets to changes in parameters representing growth, mortality, recruitment, and maturation rates for three representative life histories representing long-, medium-, and short-lived species. The elasticity analysis indicates that demographic changes can result in substantial variation in fisheries management targets, but that changes in mortality rates are particularly important for spawning biomass and catch targets while maturity and recruitment compensation are also important for fishing mortality targets. We conclude by discussing the importance of improved data repositories to address covariation among maturity, growth, and mortality parameters.},

However, many jurisdictions do not analyze fishery catch rates due to concerns that these data confound changes in fishing behavior (adjustments in fishing location or gear operation) with trends in abundance. In response, we developed a spatial dynamic factor analysis (SDFA) model that decomposes covariation in multispecies catch rates into components representing spatial variation and fishing behavior. SDFA estimates spatiotemporal variation in fish density for multiple species and accounts for fisher behavior at large spatial scales (i.e., choice of fishing location) while controlling for fisher behavior at fine spatial scales (e.g., daily timing of fishing activity). We first use a multispecies simulation experiment to show that SDFA decreases bias in abundance indices relative to ignoring spatial adjustments and fishing tactics.

  abstract = {Statistical models play an important role in fisheries science when reconciling ecological theory with available data for wild populations or experimental studies. Ecological models increasingly include both fixed and random effects, and are often estimated using maximum likelihood techniques. Quantities of biological or management interest (``derived quantities'') are then often calculated as nonlinear functions of fixed and random effect estimates. However, the conventional ``plug-in'' estimator for a derived quantity in a maximum likelihood mixed-effects model will be biased whenever the estimator is calculated as a nonlinear function of random effects. We therefore describe and evaluate a new ``epsilon'' estimator as a generic bias-correction estimator for derived quantities. We use simulated data to compare the epsilon-method with an existing bias-correction algorithm for estimating recruitment in four configurations of an age-structured population dynamics model. This simulation experiment shows that the epsilon-method and the existing bias-correction method perform equally well in data-rich contexts, but the epsilon-method is slightly less biased in data-poor contexts. We then apply the epsilon-method to a spatial regression model when estimating an index of population abundance, and compare results with an alternative bias-correction algorithm that involves Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. This example shows that the epsilon-method leads to a biologically significant difference in estimates of average abundance relative to the conventional plug-in estimator, and also gives essentially identical estimates to a sample-based bias-correction estimator. The epsilon-method has been implemented by us as a generic option in the open-source Template Model Builder software, and could be adapted within other mixed-effects modeling tools such as Automatic Differentiation Model Builder for random effects. It therefore has potential to improve estimation performance for mixed-effects models throughout fisheries science.},

  abstract = {* Changing climate is already impacting the spatial distribution of many taxa, including bees, plants, birds, butterflies and fishes. A common goal is to detect range shifts in response to climate change, including changes in the centre of the population's distribution (the centre of gravity, COG), population boundaries and area occupied. Conventional estimators, such as the abundance-weighted average (AWA) estimator for COG, confound range shifts with changes in the spatial distribution of available survey data and may be biased when the distribution of survey data shifts over time. AWA also does not estimate the standard error of COG in individual years and cannot incorporate data from multiple survey designs.

* To explicitly account for changes in the spatial distribution of survey effort, we propose an alternative species distribution function (SDF) estimator. The SDF approach involves calculating distribution metrics, including COG, population boundary and area occupied, directly from the predicted species distribution or density function. We illustrate the SDF approach using a spatiotemporal model that is available as an r package. Using simulated data, we confirm that the SDF substantially decreases bias in COG estimates relative to the AWA estimator. We then illustrate the method by analysing data from two data sets spanning 1977\textendash{}2013 for 18 marine fishes along the U.S. West Coast.

* In our case study, the SDF estimator shows significant northward shifts for six of 18 species (with southward shifts for only 2), where two species (darkblotched and greenstriped rockfishes) have both a northward shift and a decreased area occupied. Pelagic species (e.g. Pacific hake and spiny dogfish) have more variable distribution than bottom-associated species. We also find substantial differences between AWA and SDF estimates of COG that are likely caused by shifts in sampling distribution (which affect the AWA but not the SDF estimator).

* We caution that common estimators for range shift can yield inappropriate inference whenever sampling designs have shifted over time. We conclude by suggesting further improvements in model-based approaches to analysing climate impacts, including methods addressing the impact of local and regional temperature changes on species distribution.},

Spatio-temporal variation can arise from differences in habitat quality, human impacts (including harvest), density-dependent changes in per capita productivity, as well as individual movement. Human impacts (e.g. direct harvest) also vary spatially and over time, and monitoring the overlap between impacts and population distribution is necessary to ensure that human impacts are sustainable and to prioritize research and management for populations that are heavily impacted. However, estimating spatio-temporal variation in human impacts and population dynamics while accounting for individual movement has remained computationally challenging for decades.

* We developed a spatial population growth (also known as `surplus production') model that is inspired by finite element analysis, which estimates spatio-temporal population dynamics given density-dependent population regulation, individual movement and spatially explicit harvest. We demonstrate the method using data for big skate Raja binoculata in the California Current from 2003 to 2013 and demonstrate that results can be processed to estimate an upper limit on sustainable harvest (an `overfishing limit'). We also conduct a simulation experiment to explore the small-sample properties of parameter estimates.

* A simulation experiment confirms that real-world sample sizes are sufficient to estimate the sustainable harvest level within 20\% of its actual value. However, sample sizes are likely insufficient to reliably estimate movement rates.

* The spatial population growth model estimates an overfishing limit of 740\textendash{}890 metric tonnes for big skate from 2010 to 2013, compared with annual harvest {$<$}100 tonnes. This suggests that recent harvest of big skate is likely sustainable, and sensitivity analysis confirms that this conclusion is robust to different potential rates for individual movement.

* Synthesis and applications. We recommend that spatio-temporal population models be used across systems and taxa to monitor the spatial overlap between species distribution and human impacts. For big skate, we recommend management rules triggering additional data collection and assessment effort if harvest rates substantially increase. We also recommend future research regarding spatial management regulations for emerging fisheries.},

  abstract = {Several approaches have been developed over the last decade to simultaneously estimate distribution or density for multiple species (e.g. ``joint species distribution'' or ``multispecies occupancy'' models). However, there has been little research comparing estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts from these multispecies models with similar single-species estimates. We seek to determine whether a model including correlations among species (and particularly species that may affect habitat quality, termed ``biogenic habitat'') improves predictive performance or decreases standard errors for estimates of total biomass and distribution shift relative to similar single-species models. To accomplish this objective, we apply a vector-autoregressive spatio-temporal (VAST) model that simultaneously estimates spatio-temporal variation in density for multiple species, and present an application of this model using data for eight US Pacific Coast rockfishes (Sebastes spp.), thornyheads (Sebastolobus spp.), and structure-forming invertebrates (SFIs). We identified three fish groups having similar spatial distribution (northern Sebastes, coastwide Sebastes, and Sebastolobus species), and estimated differences among groups in their association with SFI. The multispecies model was more parsimonious and had better predictive performance than fitting a single-species model to each taxon individually, and estimated fine-scale variation in density even for species with relatively few encounters (which the single-species model was unable to do). However, the single-species models showed similar abundance trends and distribution shifts to those of the multispecies model, with slightly smaller standard errors. Therefore, we conclude that spatial variation in density (and annual variation in these patterns) is correlated among fishes and SFI, with congeneric fishes more correlated than species from different genera. However, explicitly modelling correlations among fishes and biogenic habitat does not seem to improve precision for estimates of abundance trends or distribution shifts for these fishes.},

  abstract = {Niche-based approaches to community analysis often involve estimating a matrix of pairwise interactions among species (the ``community matrix''), but this task becomes infeasible using observational data as the number of modeled species increases. As an alternative, neutral theories achieve parsimony by assuming that species within a trophic level are exchangeable, but generally cannot incorporate stabilizing interactions even when they are evident in field data. Finally, both regulated (niche) and unregulated (neutral) approaches have rarely been fitted directly to survey data using spatio-temporal statistical methods. We therefore propose a spatio-temporal and model-based approach to estimate community dynamics that are partially regulated. Specifically, we start with a neutral spatio-temporal model where all species follow ecological drift, which precludes estimating pairwise interactions. We then add regulatory relations until model selection favors stopping, where the ``rank'' of the interaction matrix may range from zero to the number of species. A simulation experiment shows that model selection can accurately identify the rank of the interaction matrix, and that the identified spatio-temporal model can estimate the magnitude of species interactions. A forty-year case study for the Gulf of St. Lawrence marine community shows that recovering grey seals have an unregulated and negative relation with demersal fishes. We therefore conclude that partial regulation is a plausible approximation to community dynamics using field data, and hypothesize that estimating partial regulation will be expedient in future analyses of spatio-temporal community dynamics given limited field data. We conclude by recommending ongoing research to add explicit models for movement, so that meta-community theory can be confronted with data in a spatio-temporal statistical framework.

We therefore incorporate the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution into Stock Synthesis, and propose it as a model-based method for estimating effective sample size. This distribution incorporates one additional parameter per fleet (with the option of mirroring its value among fleets), and we show that this parameter governs the ratio of nominal (``input'') and effective (``output'') sample size. We demonstrate this approach using data for Pacific hake, where the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution and an iterative reweighting approach previously developed by McAllister and Ianelli (1997) give similar results. We also use simulation testing to explore the estimation properties of this new estimator, and show that it provides approximately unbiased estimates of variance inflation when compositional samples capture clusters of individuals with similar ages/lengths. We conclude by recommending further research to develop computationally efficient estimators of effective sample size that are based on alternative, a priori consideration of sampling theory and population biology.},

  abstract = {Scientists and resource managers need to know life history parameters (e.g., average mortality rate, individual growth rate, maximum length or mass, and timing of maturity) to understand and respond to risks to natural populations and ecosystems. For over 100 years, scientists have identified ``life history invariants'' (LHI) representing pairs of parameters whose ratio is theorized to be constant across species. LHI then promise to allow prediction of many parameters from field measurements of a few important traits. Using LHI in this way, however, neglects any residual patterns in parameters when making predictions. We therefore apply a multivariate model for eight variables (seven parameters and temperature) in over 32,000 fishes, and include taxonomic structure for residuals (with levels for class, order, family, genus, and species). We illustrate that this approach predicts variables probabilistically for taxa with many or few data. We then use this model to resolve three questions regarding life history parameters in fishes. Specifically we show that (1) on average there is a 1.24\% decrease in the Brody growth coefficient for every 1\% increase in maximum size; (2) the ratio of natural mortality rate and growth coefficient is not an LHI but instead varies systematically based on the timing of maturation, where movement along this life history axis is predictably correlated with species taxonomy; and (3) three variables must be known per species to precisely predict remaining life history variables. We distribute our predictive model as an R package, FishLife, to allow future life history predictions for fishes to be conditioned on taxonomy and life history data for fishes worldwide. This package also contains predictions (and predictive intervals) for mortality, maturity, size, and growth parameters for all described fishes.},

Samples are often analysed using a ``delta-model'' that combines two separate generalized linear models, GLMs (for encounter probability and positive catch rates), or less often using a compound Poisson-gamma (CPG) distribution that is computationally expensive. I discuss three theoretical problems with the conventional delta-model: difficulty interpreting covariates for encounter probability, the assumed independence of the two GLMs, and the biologically implausible form when eliminating covariates for either GLM. I then derive an alternative ``Poisson-link model'' that solves these problems.

However, important issues remain unresolved for the Bayesian approach to stock assessment despite over 25 years of research, development, and application. Here, we explore the consequence of a common practice in Bayesian assessment models: assigning a uniform prior to the logarithm of the parameter representing population scale (log-carrying capacity for biomass-dynamics models, or log-unfished recruits for age-structured models). First, we explain why the value chosen for the upper bound of this prior will affect parameter estimates and fisheries management advice given two properties that are met for many data-poor stock assessment models. Next, we use three case studies and a simulation experiment to show a substantial impact of this decision for data-limited assessments off the US West Coast. We end by discussing four methods for generating an informative prior on the population scale parameter, but conclude that these will not be suitable for many assessments. In these cases, we advocate that maximum likelihood estimation is a simple way to avoid the use of Bayesian priors that are excessively informative.},

  abstract = {The birth and survival of juveniles (termed recruitment) is highly variable in marine populations, and this variation is not precisely predicted by spawning output or environmental effects in isolation. Variation in recruitment after accounting for differences in spawning output (termed ``recruitment deviations'') is commonly estimated in age-structured populations models that are fitted to data including samples of length or age-composition (``age-structured integrated models'', ASIM). However, recruitment deviations often are not estimated when fitting only to catch and abundance-index data (``age-structured production models'', ASPM), or catch data given an assumed value for final stock status (``age-structured stock-reduction analysis'', ASSRA). We use a simulation and real-world example to illustrate the potential benefits of estimating recruitment deviations in data-rich (ASIM), data-moderate (ASPM), and data-poor (ASSRA) models, while using either marginal likelihood or tuning algorithms with penalized likelihood estimation. The simulation experiment shows that marginal and penalized likelihood methods are both unbiased and precise for ASIM when estimating recruitment deviations, but biased and imprecise when not. The ASPM is somewhat biased both with or without estimating recruitment deviations, but is more precise when estimating recruitment deviations than not. The ASPM with recruitment deviations estimated using marginal likelihood has somewhat better performance than using penalized likelihood, although maximum likelihood also sometimes does not converge. The ASSRA has similar precision with or without estimating recruitment deviations, but estimating recruitment deviations is important to have reasonable estimates of confidence intervals. Both marginal and penalized likelihood can accurately estimate the variance of recruitment deviations for ASIM and ASPM. Estimating recruitment deviations is necessary to accurately estimate uncertainty in spawning output, and results are robust to mis-specifying the recruitment model (e.g., when simulating data with regime-shift dynamics). A sensitivity analysis shows mis-specifying maturity-at-age causes bias in all models, but bias is somewhat mitigated when estimating recruitment deviations. Finally, a case-study involving Pacific hake off the US West Coast emphasizes that it is necessary to estimate recruitment deviations to closely match results from the original assessment.},

Applying a qualitative approach, this article argues that shared beliefs and practices such as common sense, taking precautions, evaluating risk as well as relying on each other through cooperation on board and amongst vessels, can be understood as integrated or institutionalized ways of dealing with potential risk. These elements interact with the individual's personal experiences, and influence the fishermen's perceptions of the dangers at hand. The points presented here, may be a part of the reason why fishermen do not necessarily see the need for formal regulations aimed at improving their safety.},

Size-selective harvest is a primary driver of such trait change, has received much attention in the literature and is now commonly considered in fisheries management. The potential for selection on behavioural traits has received less study, but mounting evidence suggests that aggression, foraging behaviour and linked traits can also be affected by fishing. An important phenomenon that has received much less attention is selection on reproductive phenology (i.e., the timing of breeding). The potential for this type of ``temporal selection'' is widespread because there is often substantial variability in reproductive phenology within fish populations, and fisheries management strategies or fishermen's behaviours can cause fishing effort to vary greatly over time. For example, seasonal closures may expose only early or late breeding individuals to harvest as observed in a range of marine and freshwater fisheries. Such selection may induce evolutionary responses in phenological traits, but can also have demographic impacts such as shortened breeding seasons and reduced phenotypic diversity. These changes can in turn influence productivity, reduce the efficacy of management, exacerbate ongoing climate-driven changes in phenology and reduce resilience to environmental change. In this essay, we describe how fisheries management can cause temporal variability in harvest, and describe the types of selection on temporal traits that can result. We then summarize the likely biological consequences of temporally selective fishing on populations and population complexes and conclude by identifying areas for future research.},

Anthropogenic impacts and the need for systematic conservation planning have further motivated the analysis of diversity patterns and processes at regional to global scales. Whereas land diversity patterns and their predictors are known for numerous taxa, our understanding of global marine diversity has been more limited, with recent findings revealing some striking contrasts to widely held terrestrial paradigms. Here we examine global patterns and predictors of species richness across 13 major species groups ranging from zooplankton to marine mammals. Two major patterns emerged: coastal species showed maximum diversity in the Western Pacific, whereas oceanic groups consistently peaked across broad mid-latitudinal bands in all oceans. Spatial regression analyses revealed sea surface temperature as the only environmental predictor highly related to diversity across all 13 taxa. Habitat availability and historical factors were also important for coastal species, whereas other predictors had less significance. Areas of high species richness were disproportionately concentrated in regions with medium or higher human impacts. Our findings indicate a fundamental role of temperature or kinetic energy in structuring cross-taxon marine biodiversity, and indicate that changes in ocean temperature, in conjunction with other human impacts, may ultimately rearrange the global distribution of life in the ocean.},

Pieces of the model have been suggested in the literature, and these pieces are formalized here realizing the current operating parameters of the global seafood industry. The derived pull-threshold model assumes that if producers exceed the threshold, there is no incentive to improve while if too far below, improvement is most likely beyond technical or financial means. Thus, a single certification is only a marginal solution to the larger picture. Those producers immediately below the certification threshold are within range or `pull' of the threshold to improve as a result of certification. Results from a single threshold model applied to compliance data indicated that a maximum improvement of 12.5\%, achieved when the pull was the greatest and the threshold was at the lower end of the impact distribution. When impacts were continuous (e.g. escapes in aquaculture), greater improvement was observed with thresholds targeting the producers at the higher end of the impact distribution. In all cases, improvement was maximized with a triple threshold model, indicating that single threshold scenario will not drive the greatest movement towards environmental improvement throughout the industry. Innovation is potentially more important in reducing environmental impacts of seafood production and needs to be accounted for as the seafood certification or ecolabelling continues to mature.},

Ecosystem-based management and area closures are considered an effective way to maintain ecological processes, especially in marine systems. Although there is strong evidence that such measures positively affect community structure, their impact on the rate of key ecological processes remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that marine protected areas enhance herbivory rates on coral reefs via direct and indirect pathways. Using meta-analysis and a path-analytical framework, we demonstrate that, on average, protected areas increase the species richness of herbivorous fishes, which, in turn, enhances browsing rates on macroalgae. However, in all three regions studied (the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean), a small subset of the herbivore assemblage accounted for the majority of browsing. Our results therefore indicate that ecosystem functioning on coral reefs may respond positively to both area closures and the protection of key species.},

Pseudo-nitzschia have been found along most of the world's coastlines, while the impacts of its toxin, DA, are most persistent and detrimental in upwelling systems. However, Pseudo-nitzschia and DA have recently been detected in the open ocean's high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll regions, in addition to fjords, gulfs and bays, showing their presence in diverse environments. The toxin has been measured in zooplankton, shellfish, crustaceans, echinoderms, worms, marine mammals and birds, as well as in sediments, demonstrating its stable transfer through the marine food web and abiotically to the benthos. The linkage of DA production to nitrogenous nutrient physiology, trace metal acquisition, and even salinity, suggests that the control of toxin production is complex and likely influenced by a suite of environmental factors that may be unique to a particular region. Advances in our knowledge of Pseudo-nitzschia sexual reproduction, also in field populations, illustrate its importance in bloom dynamics and toxicity. The combination of careful taxonomy and powerful new molecular methods now allow for the complete characterization of Pseudo-nitzschia populations and how they respond to environmental changes. Here we summarize research that represents our increased knowledge over the last decade of Pseudo-nitzschia and its production of DA, including changes in worldwide range, phylogeny, physiology, ecology, monitoring and public health impacts.},

  abstract = {End-to-end models that represent ecosystem components from primary producers to top predators, linked through trophic interactions and affected by the abiotic environment, are expected to provide valuable tools for assessing the effects of climate change and fishing on ecosystem dynamics. Here, we review the main process-based approaches used for marine ecosystem modelling, focusing on the extent of the food web modelled, the forcing factors considered, the trophic processes represented, as well as the potential use and further development of the models. We consider models of a subset of the food web, models which represent the first attempts to couple low and high trophic levels, integrated models of the whole ecosystem, and size spectrum models. Comparisons within and among these groups of models highlight the preferential use of functional groups at low trophic levels and species at higher trophic levels and the different ways in which the models account for abiotic processes. The model comparisons also highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate spatial dimension for representing organism dynamics. Many of the reviewed models could be extended by adding components and by ensuring that the full life cycles of species components are represented, but end-to-end models should provide full coverage of ecosystem components, the integration of physical and biological processes at different scales and two-way interactions between ecosystem components. We suggest that this is best achieved by coupling models, but there are very few existing cases where the coupling supports true two-way interaction. The advantages of coupling models are that the extent of discretization and representation can be targeted to the part of the food web being considered, making their development time- and cost-effective. Processes such as predation can be coupled to allow the propagation of forcing factors effects up and down the food web. However, there needs to be a stronger focus on enabling two-way interaction, carefully selecting the key functional groups and species, reconciling different time and space scales and the methods of converting between energy, nutrients and mass.},

As existing communities have collapsed, new ones have become established, fundamentally transforming ecosystems to those that are often less productive for fisheries, more prone to cycles of booms and busts, and thus less manageable. We contend that the failure of fisheries science and management to anticipate these transformations results from a lack of appreciation for the nature, strength, complexity, and outcome of species interactions. Ecologists have come to understand that networks of interacting species exhibit nonlinear dynamics and feedback loops that can produce sudden and unexpected shifts. We argue that fisheries science and management must follow this lead by developing a sharper focus on species interactions and how disrupting these interactions can push ecosystems in which fisheries are embedded past their tipping points.},

Inspection of historic landings for small pelagics and other small species in the Northeast Atlantic (ICES area) reveals that most likely fisheries exploitation does not, and never did, exceed system productivity in most LMEs and is therefore overall sustainable, although not necessarily for individual stocks.},

Profits from fishing, discounted by the tendency to cooperate, are specified for each fisher under various circumstances and viewed as a two by two matrix game, with two players and two strategies (cooperative and non-cooperative). The payoffs in the matrix determine the equilibrium outcome for the game.

However, research has yet to determine whether identity-linked products are differentially treated at disposal in comparison to products that are not identity-linked. Across seven studies, the current research shows that when an everyday product (e.g., paper, cups, aluminum cans) is linked to a consumer's identity it is less likely to be trashed and more likely to be recycled. Further, the tendency to recycle an identity-linked product increases with the strength and positivity of the connection between the consumer and product (or brand). Finally, the disposal behavior can be explained by consumers' motivation to avoid trashing a product that is linked to the self because it is viewed as an identity-threat. In sum, consumers will be more likely to recycle (rather than trash) a product if the product is linked to a consumer's identity. This occurs because placing an identity-linked product in the trash is symbolically similar to trashing a part of the self, a situation consumers are motivated to avoid.},

  author = {Uddin, Mohammed Salim},
  year = {2011},
  month = apr,
  abstract = {Microcredit has been considered one of the most significant innovations in the field of development in the last thirty years. It provides collateral free financial resources to the poor worldwide. It plays an important role in poverty eradication, socio-economic development, livelihood diversification and women empowerment especially in the developing and under-developed nations. It has contributed positively to the natural resources management by forming social capital, creating alternate income and diversifying livelihoods of the resource dependent rural people. Natural resource management, in general, and fisheries resources management in particular, are currently undergoing a major paradigm shift. In recent years, the notion of government as the only decision-making authority has been replaced by multi-scale, polycentric governance, which recognizes that a large number of stakeholders in different institutional settings contribute to overall management of resources. Improving the management of natural or common pool resources and empowering local communities, community-based management has become a common strategy in the last two decades. Community-Based Organizations are grassroots institutions that involve rural communities in co-management. Several factors influence the functioning and sustainability of these CBOs which contribute to the management of common-pool resources in Bangladesh. To address the complexities of socio-cultural systems and sustainable natural resource management, managers, practitioners, and theoreticians widely rely on social learning. The evidence of social learning is apparent in collaborative participation and group actions where individuals meet, interact, share ideas, learn collectively and take collective decisions. They adjust the management approaches and change their perceptions according to their social learning in natural resources management.

The purpose of the research was to assess the role of microcredit in improving rural livelihoods (mainly fishing households), identify the challenges faced by microcredit institutions, and to explore the process of organizations and obstacles involved in the sustainability of Community-Based Organizations developed by CBFM-2 project in Hakaluki haor area. It was intended to explore the evidence of social learning and capacity building efforts related to microcredit and CBFM-2 project intervention in the study area.

The main objective of this research was: to assess the roles of microcredit in improving rural livelihoods with a focus on fishing households and institutional capacity-building. The secondary objectives were:  (i) to understand the processes of organization and the challenges that Community Based Organizations (CBOs) face, and (ii) to explore the evidence of social learning pertaining to microcredit and involving CBOs under CBFM-2 project, other local institutions, and fisher households.

A qualitative research approach was followed in this case which was supplemented by quantitative data. Several Participatory Rural Appraisal tools, such as interviews (households) by administering semi-structured questionnaires, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, in-depth case studies, and mini-workshops were used at different stages of the research to attain the objective of the study. Together with local communities and other relevant stakeholders the research purposively selected three CBOs and three microcredit women groups in three different villages of Hakaluki haor. 

The research findings revealed that microcredit played a significant role in socio-economic development of Hakaluki haor, especially household income increment, livelihood diversification, creation of self-employment, poverty reduction and women empowerment though it entrapped few households in vicious cycle of poverty. The research established that CBOs are instrumental and essential for community-based natural resources management through empowering the local communities, and NGOs are important for mobilizing local people, capacity building and providing legal services to the community. It was evident that CBOs faced challenges towards its sustainability due to limited resources and wetland policy changes by the government. The study also revealed the evidence of social learning through microcredit operation and project intervention which changed their perceptions and fisheries management practices. Reforming operational mechanism of microcredit, national wetland leasing policy and legitimating CBOs can remove the challenges of microcredit and help the CBOs to be sustainable. Future research is encouraged to reveal the other issues of microcredit and community-based organizations sustainability.},

  abstract = {Achieving single species maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in complex and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (mixed fisheries) is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. The North Sea mixed fisheries are a representative example of an issue that is generic across most demersal fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these interactions, new approaches have emerged. Recent paths towards operationalizing MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of ``pretty good yield'', implemented through a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This article investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible, short-term, mixed-fisheries management requirements applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may lead to unacceptable risks when technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that provides an optimal set of fishing mortality within the range, minimizing the risk of total allowable catch mismatches among stocks captured within mixed fisheries, and addressing explicitly the trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks.},

  abstract = {The livelihoods and way of life of fishing communities globally are increasingly threatened as they struggle to cope with dwindling fish stocks and an increasing regulatory regime. However, the social and cultural aspects of marine fisheries are often overlooked in fisheries policy and management frameworks that focus on the biological and economic impacts of fishing in their efforts to halt the decline in key stocks. While this is understandable, sustainable fisheries are only likely to be achieved if management approaches integrate environmental, economic and social dimensions. In order to address this, and to explore conceptual and governance issues relating to the management of sustainable marine fisheries, an international conference entitled ``It's Not Just About the Fish'' was held in London in April 2011. This introductory paper provides a summary of the themes addressed and briefly describes the thirteen papers which comprise this Special Issue of Marine Policy. It is concluded that progress is starting to be made to address the important socio-cultural impacts of marine fishing on coastal communities worldwide. However, the challenge for researchers and policy makers is to work together to develop methodologies that allow the social and cultural values of marine fisheries to be fully accounted for and integrated into fisheries and marine policy.},

  abstract = {Monitoring by local community managers tightens the adaptive management cycle by linking management more closely with its evaluation, so management actions become more responsive to the field situation. Local community volunteers, usually fishers, managing coral reef protected areas in the Philippines used simple methods (e.g. snorkeling fish visual census) to periodically monitor and evaluate reef protection together with professional marine biologists. Except for estimates of hard coral, data collected by local volunteers were not significantly correlated with data collected by biologists (specifically abundance estimates of sand, major reef fish carnivores, and fish herbivores). Community-collected fish data generally have higher variance and show higher abundances than biologist-collected data. Nonetheless, though the data was less precise, the locally based monitoring identified or confirmed the need for management actions that were generic in nature (e.g. stronger enforcement, organizational strengthening, etc.). The locally based monitoring also encouraged cooperation among stakeholders and prompted a management response. Little time and financing is required after initial establishment and replication has been increasing. However, sustainability depends upon the communities' perceived added-value of undertaking the monitoring and input from a paid and/or more committed local person (e.g. government) who occasionally conducts monitoring himself/herself and supervises the community monitoring. Management impact depends heavily upon good integration with active management interventions outside the monitoring effort per se},

Despite increasing evidence of their usefulness, questions remain regarding the optimal design of MPAs, in particular concerning their function as fisheries management tools, for which empirical studies are still lacking. Using 28 data sets from seven MPAs in Southern Europe, we developed a meta-analytical approach to investigate the effects of protection on adjacent fisheries and asking how these effects are influenced by MPA size and age. Southern European MPAs showed clear effects on the surrounding fisheries, on the `catch per unit effort' (CPUE) of target species, but especially on the CPUE of the marketable catch. These effects depended on the time of protection and on the size of the no-take area. CPUE of both target species and the marketable catch increased gradually by 2\textendash{}4\% per year over a long time period (at least 30~years). The influence of the size of the no-take area appeared to be more complex. The catch rates of the entire fishery in and around the MPA were higher when the no-take areas were smaller. Conversely, catch rates of selected fisheries that were expected to benefit most from protection increased when the no-take area was larger. Our results emphasize the importance of MPA size on its export functions and suggest that an adequate, often extended, time frame be used for the management and the evaluation of effectiveness of MPAs.},

  abstract = {The term data augmentation refers to methods for constructing iterative optimization or sampling algorithms via the introduction of unobserved data or latent variables. For deterministic algorithms, the method was popularized in the general statistical community by the seminal article by Dempster, Laird, and Rubin on the EM algorithm for maximizing a likelihood function or, more generally, a posterior density. For stochastic algorithms, the method was popularized in the statistical literature by Tanner and Wong's Data Augmentation algorithm for posterior sampling and in the physics literature by Swendsen and Wang's algorithm for sampling from the Ising and Potts models and their generalizations; in the physics literature, the method of data augmentation is referred to as the method of auxiliary variables. Data augmentation schemes were used by Tanner and Wong to make simulation feasible and simple, while auxiliary variables were adopted by Swendsen and Wang to improve the speed of iterative simulation. In general, however, constructing data augmentation schemes that result in both simple and fast algorithms is a matter of art in that successful strategies vary greatly with the (observed-data) models being considered. After an overview of data augmentation/auxiliary variables and some recent developments in methods for constructing such efficient data augmentation schemes, we introduce an effective search strategy that combines the ideas of marginal augmentation and conditional augmentation, together with a deterministic approximation method for selecting good augmentation schemes. We then apply this strategy to three common classes of models (specifically, multivariate t, probit regression, and mixed-effects models) to obtain efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior sampling. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the resulting algorithms, while requiring similar programming effort, can show dramatic improvement over the Gibbs samplers commonly used for these models in practice. A key feature of all these new algorithms is that they are positive recurrent subchains of nonpositive recurrent Markov chains constructed in larger spaces.},

The WFcons related to the consumption of agricultural products (4265 l per capita per day or lcd) accounts for 89\% of the EU's total WFcons (4815 lcd).

The current zonal WFcons regarding agricultural products is: 5875 lcd (SOUTH), 4053 lcd (EAST), 3761 lcd (WEST) and 3197 lcd (NORTH). These differences are the result of different consumption behaviours as well as different agricultural production methods and conditions. From the perspective of a healthy diet based on regional dietary guidelines, the intake of several product groups (sugar, crop oils, animal fats and meat) should be decreased and increased for others (vegetables, fruit). The WFcons regarding agricultural products for the alternative diets are the following: HEALTHY 4110 lcd (- 30\%) and VEG 3476 lcd (- 41\%) for SOUTH; HEALTHY 3606 lcd (- 11\%) and VEG 2956 lcd (- 27\%) for EAST; HEALTHY 2766 lcd (- 26\%) and VEG 2208 lcd (- 41\%) for WEST; HEALTHY 3091 lcd (- 3\%) and VEG 2166 lcd (- 32\%) for NORTH.

By far the largest fraction of the total WFcons (4815 lcd) relates to the consumption of edible agricultural goods (84\%). The average EU28 diet is characterised by a too high energy intake and a too high ratio of animal to vegetal protein intake. For a healthy diet, the intake of some product groups should be reduced (sugar, crop oils, meat and animal fats) and of other product groups increased (vegetables and fruit). Especially the consumption of animal products accounts for high WF amounts. The three alternative diets result in a substantial reduction (-974 lcd or -23\% for DGE, -1292 lcd or -30\% for COM, -1611 lcd or -38\% for VEG) of the WFcons for agricultural products with respect to the existing situation (REF, 4265 lcd). The reduction in meat intake contributes most to the WF reduction. Each of the specific WF components (green, blue and grey) shows a reduction similar to the observed reduction in the total WFcons. Regarding the total WFcons (green, blue and grey WFcons) as well as the WFcons without the grey WF component (green + blue WFcons) for agricultural products, the EU28 shifts from net virtual water (VW) importer for the REF and DGE diets to net exporter for the COM and VEG diets.},

Predation mortality was a flexible function of predator and prey abundances that was fitted to stomach-content data. A proof of concept illustration is presented here, assessing model outputs against a set of single-species models.

  abstract = {The Tasmanian rock lobster industry has been managed by Individually Transferable Quotas (ITQs) and several input control measures since 1998. In this study, nine years of rock lobster fishing business data were used to categorise the catch and quota ownership traits and examine the response to the introduction of ITQ management. More specifically the study investigates how profit drivers moderated industry structure change. Owners who are not active fishers (investors) have steadily grown in number with a commensurate expansion of the lease quota market. A cap on the maximum allowed number of quota units per legal entity of 200 units (around 2\% of the total) was implemented at the start of ITQ management and this has proven effective in the maintenance of diverse ownership with little processor control. Active fishers who lease in quota (lease dependent fishers) took a large proportion of the total catch in 2007. An economic pressure to expand lease operations was identified, which accrued through better utilisation of capital. The pressure to increase in size through leasing in quota exists for businesses with small holdings. In contrast, as ownership of quota increased to approximately 30 units, the marginal profitability of fishers increased through the opposite process, that is, reducing fishing activity and supplementing income by leasing out quota. Income supplementing appears to be a transitional state, and in time these quota owners will move to the more stable state of ``investor''. Thus the fishery is trending towards a smaller number of highly active lease fishers with units supplied by a broad group of investors. Lease fishers need to move into the large-scale category catching at least 75 units to achieve a normal economic profit and remain viable in the long run. However, they face barriers to entry to this large catch category through high upfront capital investment costs. Other potential issues for management that arise are that their higher financial stress increases compliance risk and their lack of investment in quota assets reduces incentive for stewardship of the resource.},

  abstract = {Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) management systems are typically introduced to promote better capital utilisation by the fishing fleet and other efficiency gains. ITQ management was introduced in the Tasmanian rock lobster industry in 1998 and led to a range of economic, social and cultural changes including an increasing proportion of the catch taken by fishers dependent on quota leasing. Quota owners who lease out their entire quota increasingly dominated ownership of the fishery.
Temporal changes in lease quota trade networks and network characteristics were analysed, which showed that the lease quota trade network has become more integrated and the influence of personal connections less important. Change in the network structure of the market indicated that a smaller number of quota owners have become increasingly dominant in this market although there was no evidence that this had an effect on quota lease prices.
Processors also participated in the lease quota market and influenced interactions and dependencies. In other jurisdictions processor relationships have been found to affect lease quota price developments. However, disproportionate quota ownership by processors and market manipulation did not occur here. This was due to a successful input control where quota ownership by one legal entity was capped. Because market control cannot be gained through investment in quota, another logical way of gaining it would be for processors to operate as pseudo brokers and distribute lease quota for quota owners. Although processors in Tasmania operate as pseudo brokers, the absence of structural changes in the processor market indicated that this produced no change in market power or quota owner loyalties.},

  abstract = {In the domain of decision-support tools for the management of marine fish resources, considerable attention has been paid to the development of models explaining how fish stocks change over space and time. In most models, fishing effort is assumed to be exogenous and determined by factors such as management. Increasingly, there has been a call for bio-economic models to also account for the dynamics of fishing fleets, recognizing that fishers respond to changing environmental, institutional and economic conditions. A growing literature has sought to explicitly model the endogenous determinants of the capacity of fishing fleets, the intensity of its use and its temporal and spatial allocation across fishing opportunities. We review this literature, focusing on empirical applications of the behavioural models that have been put forward to explain and predict observed fleet dynamics. We find that although economic factors are usually included as a dominant driver in most studies, this is often based on the use of proxy variables for the key economic drivers, for which adequate data are lacking. Also, while many studies acknowledge that social and social\textendash{}psychological factors play a significant role in explaining observed fishing behaviour, their inclusion in fishing fleet dynamic models is still very limited. Progress in this domain can only be achieved via the development of multidisciplinary research programmes focusing on applied quantitative analysis of the drivers of fishing fleet dynamics.},

  abstract = {Classic natal dispersal studies focus mainly on distance travelled. Although distances capture some of the main selective pressures related to dispersal, this approach cannot easily incorporate the properties of the actual destination vs. the available alternatives. Recently, movement ecology studies have addressed questions on movement decisions in relation to availability of resources and/or availability of suitable habitats through the use of discrete choice models (DCMs), a widely used type of models within econometrics, which explains individual choices as a function of the properties of a finite number of alternatives. In this contribution, we show how the dispersal discrete choice model (DDCM) can be used for analysing natal dispersal data in patchy environments given that the natal and the breeding area of the disperser are observed. We test this method using a case study on Great Tits (Parus major) in an archipelago of small woodlots. Our results show that DDCMs are able to capture the results of classic distance-based approaches and simultaneously allow testing hypotheses on how departure and settlement are affected by variables that characterize the disperser, the natal patch and the breeding area, as well as their interactions. DDCMs can be applied to any other species and system that uses some form of discrete breeding location or a certain degree of discretization can be applied.},

The agricultural sector in Spain consumes up to 80\% of all available hydric resources and the need to increase the efficiency of current uses of water in the agricultural sector is at the core of the country's national water policy. One alternative would be to resort to water pricing policies with the aim of providing incentives to save water consumption although it would inflict a certain degree of income losses to the farmers and raise the revenue collected by the water authorities. The objective of this research is to analyze the effect caused by the application of different water pricing policies on water demand, farmers' income and the revenue collected by the government agency. To undertake this analysis a dynamic mathematical programming model has been built that simulates farmers' behavior and their response to different water pricing scenarios. Empirical application of the model has been carried out in several irrigation districts in Spain covering varied farm regions and river basins. Results show that the effects of alternative pricing policies for irrigation water are strongly dependent on regional, structural and institutional conditions and that changing policies produce distinct consequences within the same region and water district. Thus, equivalent water charges would create widespread effects on water savings, farm income and collected government revenue across regions and districts.},

  abstract = {The creation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and MPA networks is increasing globally. This trend is reflected in England's waters, where 34.7\% of waters are protected. MPA network creation can displace activities (primarily fisheries) that are thought to be incompatible with the habitats and species of conservation importance that the network has been established to protect. There is also an obligation on the UK Government to ensure that all of its waters achieve Good Environmental Status (GES) by 2020 under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. The designation of MPAs and the subsequent introduction of management measures that displace activities may result in unintended impacts/consequences on protected benthic habitats or species within (a) the MPA where management measures have been introduced, (b) other MPAs or (c) wider UK or international waters. An incomplete understanding of the extent and type of fishing that is occurring within the MPA network (and throughout English waters in general), coupled with a paucity of information regarding how fishing effort is displaced as a result of MPA designation, may hinder the achievement of both GES by 2020 and MPA management goals. Better understanding of fishing effort displacement can inform the siting of future MPAs, aid marine spatial planning and improve existing MPA management. To aid the better description and understanding of the various facets of fisheries effort displacement, this paper proposes for the first time a structure to differentiate the types of fisheries displacement. Measures to mitigate the consequences of displaced fishing effort are also identified.},

  abstract = {The reproductive strategies of the spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus, in relation to environmental factors (temperature and upwelling) were determined in Baja California during 1989\textendash{}1999. Two reproductive indices, R1 and R2, are proposed, based on the rate of occurrence of females with spermatophores and ovigerous females, respectively. P. interruptus spawned one brood annually between April and August. The size at which 50\% of females were sexually mature was 72.6 mm carapace length (CL), which is well below the current minimum legal size of 82.5 mm CL. Mating and deposition of spermatophores began under moderate sea surface temperature (SST) and low upwelling conditions, but higher rates of deposition were coincident with low SST and strong upwelling. A high value of R1 generally occurred between 12.8 and 16.8 \textdegree{}C, and in general was inversely correlated with winter\textendash{}spring temperature. Egg-bearing females were present in waters with a temperature range of 12.5\textendash{}24 \textdegree{}C, and peaked at 14\textendash{}19.2 \textdegree{}C. Embryonic development and larval hatching coincided with weakening Ekman transport and seasonal ocean warming. Timing of breeding was strongly temperature dependent. El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a condition impacts were particularly evident at the onset and duration of breeding. Warmer temperatures during El Ni{\~n}o periods accelerated breeding significantly, while the contrary happened under cold temperatures during La Ni{\~n}a. Females responded rapidly to declining winter temperatures and began to mate as early as December or as late as February/March. Similarly, oviposition and hatching were accelerated in response to increasing summer temperatures and finished as early as July and as late as September. The relationship between reproduction and the environment suggests that reproductive pattern and larval recruitment are coupled to dominant physical features of the California Current. Since environmental variability impacts on the onset and duration of breeding, the use of flexible management criteria is recommended, in order to guarantee that the opening and closing dates of the fishing season can be adjusted to take account of this unpredictability. This approach, in conjunction with monitoring of reproductive activity, will benefit the fishery by maximising the species' annual reproductive success.},

Theory proposes that early warning signals may be based on the phenomenon that recovery rates from small perturbations should tend to zero when approaching a tipping point; however, evidence that this happens in living systems is lacking. Here we test such /`critical slowing down/' using a microcosm in which photo-inhibition drives a cyanobacterial population to a classical tipping point when a critical light level is exceeded. We show that over a large range of conditions, recovery from small perturbations becomes slower as the system comes closer to the critical point. In addition, autocorrelation in the subtle fluctuations of the system/'s state rose towards the tipping point, supporting the idea that this metric can be used as an indirect indicator of slowing down. Although stochasticity prohibits prediction of the timing of critical transitions, our results suggest that indicators of slowing down may be used to rank complex systems on a broad scale from resilient to fragile.},

Although shifts in productivity regimes have been described, their frequency and intensity have not previously been assessed. We use a database of trends in harvest and abundance of 230 fish stocks to evaluate the proportion of fish stocks in which productivity is primarily related to abundance vs. those that appear to manifest regimes of high or low productivity. We evaluated the statistical support for four hypotheses: (i) the abundance hypothesis, where production is always related to population abundance; (ii) the regimes hypothesis, where production shifts irregularly between regimes that are unrelated to abundance; (iii) the mixed hypothesis, where even though production is related to population abundance, there are irregular changes in this relationship; and (iv) the random hypothesis, where production is random from year to year. We found that the abundance hypothesis best explains 18.3\% of stocks, the regimes hypothesis 38.6\%, the mixed hypothesis 30.5\%, and the random hypothesis 12.6\%. Fisheries management agencies need to recognize that irregular changes in productivity are common and that harvest regulation and management targets may need to be adjusted whenever productivity changes.},

Many of the data-intensive approaches to fishery management are infeasible in these fisheries, but one strategy that has rapidly emerged to overcome these challenges is the establishment of Territorial User Rights for Fisheries (TURFs). TURFs establish exclusive fishing zones for groups of stakeholders, which eliminates the race to fish with other groups. A key design challenge however is setting the size of TURFs\textemdash{}too large and the number of stakeholders sharing them impedes collective action; too small and the movement of target fish species in and out of the TURFs effectively removes the community's exclusive access. Here, we assess the size of 137 TURFs from across the globe in relation to these design challenges. We project that roughly two thirds of TURFs in our sample are already sized ideally to overcome the challenges posed by movement and group size. However, for most of the remaining TURFs, we project that all possible sizes would either be too small to overcome the movement challenge or too large to overcome the collective action challenge. Our results suggest that these fisheries, which target mobile species in densely populated regions, may need additional interventions to be successful. This article is protected by copyright.

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems provide a range of valuable services, some of which come with market prices to quantify value and others for which markets have not set prices. Lacking perfect information, policy makers are at risk of undercounting non-priced values and services, leading to biases in policy decisions in favor of services valued through markets. Furthermore, understanding users' valuation of specific site attributes, such as marine biodiversity, can contribute to effective policy decisions. This paper presents a non-market valuation of private recreational boaters (PRBs) in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary located in California, USA, using data from an intercept survey conducted in 2006 and 2007. A Random Utility Model is used to estimate PRBs' daily trip values and the importance of specific site attributes. The average consumer surplus was estimated at \$48.62 per trip, with a total non-market value of non-consumptive private recreational boating of \$86,325 annually. PRBs show a preference for visiting locations with lower exposure to prevailing winds and greater species richness and abundance, which to the authors' knowledge is the first time that PRBs have been found to value biological diversity in site choices. Furthermore, this suggests that improved biodiversity and productivity of marine ecosystems contribute to better recreational experiences. The results from this study reveal the importance of including non-market services and stakeholder's preferences into policy decisions.},

This MSC certified (2012) small-scale fishery, has been co-managed as a Territorial Use Rights Fishery (TURF) since 1969. Members of the local fishing cooperative, have exclusive access to individual fishing grounds. The fishery is based on the use of artificial shelters. These bottom devices provide refuges for lobsters, reduce predation mortality, and facilitate harvesting by free diving and the use of hand nets. Data from the fishing cooperative logbooks were used to calculate fishing incomes indicators per fisher (revenues, quasi-profits of the variable costs, profits, and resource rent) achieved in seven lobster fishing seasons (2007\textendash{}2014). Distributions statistics (shape parameters and log transformations), and inequality metrics (Lorenz curve and Gini index G) were applied to the income indicators. The analysis was complemented with a fishers' perceptions survey about the effectiveness of joint Government and cooperative regulations. The G index of the fishing revenues distributions showed low values (0.387 {$\pm$} 0.017) and a stable trend in the seven lobster seasons analyzed. The calculated G values of the fishing income indicators increased from 0.387 to 0.490. There were no statistically significant differences in the resource rent earned by the age groups of campo owners. This finding could indicate intergenerational equity among current resource users. The results showed that in the lobster fishery of Punta Allen, the fishing incomes are spread more equally than most fisheries where distributional performance has been assessed.},

  abstract = {Coastal marine ecosystems provide livelihoods for small-scale fishers and coastal communities around the world. Small-scale fisheries face great challenges since they are difficult to monitor, enforce, and manage, which may lead to overexploitation. Combining territorial use rights for fisheries (TURF) with no-take marine reserves to create TURF-reserves can improve the performance of small-scale fisheries by buffering fisheries from environmental variability and management errors, while ensuring that fishers reap the benefits of conservation investments. Since 2012, 18 old and new community-based Mexican TURF-reserves gained legal recognition thanks to a regulation passed in 2012; their effectiveness has not been formally evaluated. We combine causal inference techniques and the Social-Ecological Systems framework to provide a holistic evaluation of community-based TURF-reserves in three coastal communities in Mexico. We find that, overall, reserves have not yet achieved their stated goals of increasing the density of lobster and other benthic invertebrates, nor increasing lobster catches. A lack of clear ecological and socioeconomic effects likely results from a combination of factors. First, some of these reserves might be too young for the effects to show (reserves were 6\textendash{}10 years old). Second, the reserves are not large enough to protect mobile species, like lobster. Third, variable and extreme oceanographic conditions have impacted harvested populations. Fourth, local fisheries are already well managed, and while reserves may protect populations within its boundaries, it is unlikely that reserves might have a detectable effect in catches. However, even small reserves are expected to provide benefits for sedentary invertebrates over longer time frames, with continued protection. These reserves may provide a foundation for establishing additional, larger marine reserves needed to effectively conserve mobile species.},

In this paper, we present a method to assist the identification of fish species on underwater images, and we compare our model performances to human ability in terms of speed and accuracy. We first tested the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with different photographic databases while accounting for different post-processing decision rules to identify 20 fish species. Finally, we compared the performance of species identification of our best CNN model with that of humans on a test database of 1197 fish images representing nine species. The best CNN was the one trained with 900,000 images including (i) whole fish bodies, (ii) partial fish bodies and (iii) the environment (e.g. reef bottom or water). The rate of correct identification was 94.9\%, greater than the rate of correct identification by humans (89.3\%). The CNN was also able to identify fish individuals partially hidden behind corals or behind other fish and was more effective than humans to identify fish on smallest or blurry images while humans were better to identify fish individuals in unusual positions (e.g. twisted body). On average, each identification by our best CNN using a common hardware took 0.06 s. Deep Learning methods can thus perform efficient fish identification on underwater images and offer promises to build-up new video-based protocols for monitoring fish biodiversity cheaply and effectively.},

These results explain why policy reforms to limit special interest spending often fail. This unified model also sheds new light on when legislatures prefer open or closed amendment rules and when coalitions take different sizes and shapes.},

A mortality limit (termed the Potential Biological Removal, PBR, under the U. S. Marine Mammal Protection Act) was calculated as the product of a minimum population estimate (NMIN), one-half of the maximum net productivity rate (RMAX), and a recovery factor (FR). Mortality limits were evaluated based on whether at least 95\% of the simulated populations met two criteria: (1) that populations starting at the maximum net productivity level (MNPL) stayed there or above after 20 yr, and (2) that populations starting at 30\% of carrying-capacity (K) recovered to at least MNPL after 100 yr. Simulations of populations that experienced mortality equal to the PBR indicated that using approximately the 20th percentile (the lower 60\% log-normal confidence limit) of the abundance estimate for NMIN met the criteria for both cetaceans (assuming RMAX= 0.04) and pinnipeds (assuming RMAX= 0.12). Additional simulations that included plausible levels of bias in the available information indicated that using a value of 0.5 for FR would meet both criteria during these ``bias trials.'' It is concluded that any marine mammal population with an estimate of human-caused mortality that is greater than its PBR has a level of mortality that could lead to the depletion of the population. The simulation methods were also used to show how mortality limits could be calculated to meet conservation goals other than the U. S. goal of maintaining populations above MNPL.},

This paper gives a critical overview of advances in assessing the relative importance of pre- and post-settlement processes to the recruitment of 14 commercially and/or ecologically important lobsters and crabs. Three case studies (western rock lobster, Panulirus cygnus, blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, and the American lobster, Homarus americanus) are used to illustrate where standard fishery survey methods, combined with field experiments, have provided insights into the form of stock\textendash{}recruit relationships and the ecological processes that influence them. It is notable that larval supply-dominated cases, such as that of P. cygnus, may be less common than those dominated by post-settlement processes, such as C. sapidus, in which strong compensatory processes lead to non-linear spawner-to-recruit or juvenile-to-recruit relationships. In other cases, such as H. americanus, the influence of post-settlement controls remains controversial. Significant settler or juvenile-to-recruit linkages have been reported more often than spawner-to-recruit relationships, most likely because pre-settlement processes often mask the latter. Innovative field experiments, early life stage monitoring and spatial modeling have improved our understanding of the influence of competition, predation, cannibalism, sociality and movements to the demography of some of these species. Field experiments have been more widely used by American and Australian than European investigators. Ecological experiments are not a panacea, though, and can lead to misinterpretation, especially of the relative importance of mortality and emigration. Uncertainties about age and the relevant spatial scale at which to evaluate stock\textendash{}recruitment relationships have posed further challenges. This review underscores the need to design ecological studies at a geographic scale that will better reveal the stock\textendash{}recruitment relationship.},

  abstract = {Abstract How many species one recognizes within a given taxon remains a difficult question, especially when morphology is relatively stable or when clinal variation is present, thus complicating diagnosis. I accept the general lineage concept of species, and my goal is to recognize historically distinct evolutionary lineages that are likely to remain distinct. Here I analyze this task with respect to patterns of species formation in two genera of plethodontid salamanders in California. Ensatina is a ring species complex surrounding the Central Valley of California. At present it is a single species with seven subspecies that are linked by apparent clinal variation in intergrade zones, but there are also some narrow hybrid zones where morphologically and ecologically differentiated forms interact. In contrast, Batrachoseps, which has much the same distribution, has about 20 species in California, most occurring in sympatry with Ensatina. Divergence in the two taxa is based on two fundamentally different phenomena, and yet there are some common themes. Adaptive divergence in coloration is the dominant theme in Ensatina, whereas differentiation is largely perceived at the molecular level in Batrachoseps. Yet both have evolved in the same region and have been affected by many of the same climatic and earth historical phenomena. Within the Ensatina complex, different adaptations related to predator avoidance have evolved. Coloration has diverged in different directions in coastal and inland populations, even though genetic interactions continue to take place. Where coastal populations meet other coastal populations, ecologically and morphologically similar populations merge genetically, even if well differentiated in molecular traits. In contrast, where the ring is crossed and where ecologically and morphologically differentiated populations meet, they hybridize narrowly or are sympatric and behave as if they are species. Within the ring-like distribution, clinal patterns of variation occur. The current polytypic taxonomy is retained, even though it is problematic, because alternatives are even less appropriate. In contrast, where genetically differentiated populations of Batrachoseps meet they typically do not merge. Instead, they replace one another spatially, in part because they are so similar ecologically. Apparently the periods of isolation were sufficiently long that even in the absence of adaptive divergence there has been divergence of isolating mechanisms. Analysis of patterns of genetic differentiation in allozymes and mtDNA in relation to the geological history of California is used to generate biogeographic scenarios to help explain the contrast between Batrachoseps and Ensatina.},

A critical determinant of success in achieving these goals is the financing that is committed to maintaining biodiversity; however, financing decisions are hindered by considerable uncertainty over the likely impact of any conservation investment. For greater effectiveness, we need an evidence-based model that shows how conservation spending quantitatively reduces the rate of biodiversity loss. Here we demonstrate such a model, and empirically quantify how conservation investment between 1996 and 2008 reduced biodiversity loss in 109 countries (signatories to the Convention on Biological Diversity and Sustainable Development Goals), by a median average of 29\% per country. We also show that biodiversity changes in signatory countries can be predicted with high accuracy, using a dual model that balances the effects of conservation investment against those of economic, agricultural and population growth (human development pressures). Decision-makers can use this model to forecast the improvement that any proposed biodiversity budget would achieve under various scenarios of human development pressure, and then compare these forecasts to any chosen policy target. We find that the impact of spending decreases as human development pressures grow, which implies that funding may need to increase over time. The model offers a flexible tool for balancing the Sustainable Development Goals of human development and maintaining biodiversity, by predicting the dynamic changes in conservation finance that will be needed as human development proceeds.},

This paper describes the pre-conditions, process, and the first two years of results of a precedent setting ecosystem based management plan to address the habitat impacts of bottom trawling in Canada's Pacific waters. In British Columbia, Canada, industry and conservation organizations worked collaboratively over a period of three years outside of government to develop measures which formally took effect on April 2, 2012. The measures include four main components: (1) ecosystem based trawling boundaries; (2) the world's first habitat quota; (3) an encounter protocol; and (4) formation of a habitat review committee. It is demonstrated that measures implemented have resulted in reduced impacts to sensitive benthic habitat features such as coral and sponge complexes. It is concluded that the conditions required to produce this agreement are not unique to British Columbia, yet that the potential to develop a similar agreement and management reform elsewhere does require a unique set of conditions involving seafood markets, an effective ENGO sector, a strong regulatory environment, intra-industry cooperation, and the proper incentives.},

The first three species were analyzed on a fishery-wide basis. For sailfish, the fishery data came exclusively from tuna-targeted longline sets in the deep-set sector of the Hawaii-based fishery. We used fishery observer data from the NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands Regional Observer Program to fit the CPUE standardization models. In this context, our objective was to investigate the quality of model fit for five types of generalized linear models (GLMs: Poisson; negative binomial; zero-inflated Poisson; zero-inflated negative binomial; delta-Gamma). Each of these models represented a different hypothesis about the capture process for a bycatch species for which the catch data primarily consisted of zero catch observations. The five GLMs were fitted by forward entry variable selection, and the best fitting GLM for each species was selected on the basis of Akaike Information Criterion values and calculated Akaike weights. The best-fitting model selected for each species was a zero-inflated negative binomial GLM (ZINB). The ZINB model was comprised of a negative binomial counts model for expected zero catch sets and a positive catch per set distribution along with a binomial inflation model to account for excess zeros. For each species, the important explanatory variables for standardizing CPUE were fishing year, fishing (i.e., calendar) quarter, and fishing region. The best-fitting models indicated that standardized CPUE for striped and blue marlins decreased significantly during the study period. Because the ZINB model was selected as the best fitting model for all species, we suggest that longline CPUE for incidentally caught billfishes is best represented as a process characterized by zero inflation and overdispersion in the positive catches and expected zero catches. We therefore recommend that ZINB models be considered as an a priori model for CPUE standardizations of billfishes and other bycatch species in longline fisheries.},

Correcting for effective area fished in fishery-dependent depletion estimates of abundance and capture efficiency. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science 64: 000\textendash{}000. Depletion methods are widely used to estimate capture efficiency and abundance. However, they are highly dependent on the depletion area assumed. In open-ocean depletion studies, it is difficult to determine the true area of depletion. Satellite vessel monitoring systems (VMS) offer the potential to determine the area effectively fished. Observer-collected catch-and-effort data from the 1999 Atlantic sea scallop fishery in Georges Bank Closed Area II were used to obtain spatially-explicit DeLury depletion estimates of dredge efficiency and abundance, with corrections for fished area made using VMS data. Non-area-corrected efficiency estimates often had theoretically impossible values, indicating that the na{\"i}vely assumed fished area was likely too big. Fine-scale spatial analyses on individual depletion cells confirmed this result. Corrected-area efficiency estimates exhibited reduced variability and more plausible efficiencies, with 70\% of 289 individual depletion estimates falling between 20\% and 55\%, with a mean of 46\%. Abundance estimates from individual depletion studies matched maps of abundance from a preseason survey. Results indicated a total abundance of {$\sim$}17 million pounds of scallop meat weight in the fished area, of which 6 million pounds were landed, providing an overall exploitation rate of 35\%.},

Much mismanagement in the past has come from preoccupation with one of these scales, while using very simplistic data or assumptions about the others. For long-term management, the most fundamental need is to monitor and maintain suitable habitats. For the medium term (each salmon generation), the need will always be for empirical experience of the basic relationship between how many fish spawn and subsequent production of recruits, and how this relationship is linked to freshwater habitat factors subject to management. Knowing the key environmental factors that cause variation in the relationship would be helpful, but the most important need is to establish the average relationship so that managers can set wise escapement goals. For short-term or ``inseason'' management, where we try to meet both escapement goals defined by long-term studies and complex allocation goals, the most critical need today is for innovative abundance indexing systems to measure interannual variation in spatial distribution and timing of migration through fishing areas.},

Key populations can be represented in further detail by using delay-difference models to account for both biomass and numbers dynamics. A major problem revealed by linking the population and biomass dynamics models is in representation of population responses to changes in food supply; simple proportional growth and reproductive responses lead to unrealistic predictions of changes in mean body size with changes in fishing mortality. EcoSim II allows users to specify life history mechanisms to avoid such unrealistic predictions: animals may translate changes in feeding rate into changes in reproductive rather than growth rates, or they may translate changes in food availability into changes in foraging time that in turn affects predation risk. These options, along with model relationships for limits on prey availability caused by predation avoidance tactics, tend to cause strong compensatory responses in modeled populations. It is likely that such compensatory responses are responsible for our inability to find obvious correlations between interacting trophic components in fisheries time-series data. But Ecosim II does not just predict strong compensatory responses: it also suggests that large piscivores may be vulnerable to delayed recruitment collapses caused by increases in prey species that are in turn competitors/predators of juvenile piscivores.},

  abstract = {Management for sustainable fisheries requires effective tactics for limiting exploitation rates. Limitation based on annual stock assessments and total allowable catches calculated from these assessments can be very dangerous, and marine protected areas (MPAs) are one means by which
to limit exploitation rate directly even when total stock size is highly uncertain. This application of MPAs would probably require much larger areas than are now envisioned for limited objectives related to protection of seed spawning stock and local biodiversity. It might in fact cause a
basic shift in thinking\textemdash{}from regarding MPAs as exceptional areas to regarding fishing areas as the exception (as is now the practice in, e.g., salmon and herring fisheries). The present paper describes the use of ECOSPACE, a new modeling tool based on ecosystem simulations, for preliminary
determination of how large MPAs need to be; ECOSPACE models suggest that dispersal, trophic responses (prey depletion, increased dispersal of predators in response to competition), and spatial fishing-effort responses (concentration of fishing near MPA boundaries) are all likely to reduce
the effectiveness of small MPAs. The models suggest we should see not simple high-low density differences across MPA boundaries but rather spatial gradients from low density in exploited areas to high density near the centers of larger MPAs. Such spatial density gradients should be accompanied
by spatially organized 'trophic cascade' patterns if trophic interactions are important determinants of abundance. MPA design can work with or against spatial variation in fishing effort caused by economic cost and risk factors; ECOSPACE can help to demonstrate ecological consequences of alternative
design strategies, but the most important uncertainties are about socioeconomic responses (cooperation or competition) rather than ecological ones. Design of experimental policies and monitoring programs for evaluation of MPAs should proceed from careful modeling to define likely spatial,
temporal, and trophic scales for both ecological and fishing responses.},

But if vulnerability to predation is determined by stress factors like hunger and parasite loads that would result in higher mortality rates of vulnerable forage fish individuals even if predators were removed, there may be little decrease in forage fish natural mortality rates and hence little or no increase in net production rates. We propose a vulnerability exchange model to account for such effects, and this model predicts that under such conditions there may be little or no increase in forage fish productivity when predator abundances are reduced. We present a case study of harbour seal predation on Chinook and coho salmon, which underlines that uncertainty about additive mortality is important for evaluating alternative hypotheses of direct predation and indirect environmental impacts.

  abstract = {Background
Increasingly, underwater visual censuses (UVC) are used to assess fish populations. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of protected areas for increasing fish abundance or provided insight into the natural abundance and structure of reef fish communities in remote areas. Recently, high apex predator densities ({$>$}100,000 individuals{$\cdot$}km-2) and biomasses ({$>$}4 tonnes{$\cdot$}ha-1) have been reported for some remote islands suggesting the occurrence of inverted trophic biomass pyramids. However, few studies have critically evaluated the methods used for sampling conspicuous and highly mobile fish such as sharks. Ideally, UVC are done instantaneously, however, researchers often count animals that enter the survey area after the survey has started, thus performing non-instantaneous UVC.

Methodology/Principal Findings
We developed a simulation model to evaluate counts obtained by divers deploying non-instantaneous belt-transect and stationary-point-count techniques. We assessed how fish speed and survey procedure (visibility, diver speed, survey time and dimensions) affect observed fish counts. Results indicate that the bias caused by fish speed alone is huge, while survey procedures had varying effects. Because the fastest fishes tend to be the largest, the bias would have significant implications on their biomass contribution. Therefore, caution is needed when describing abundance, biomass, and community structure based on non-instantaneous UVC, especially for highly mobile species such as sharks.

Conclusions/Significance
Based on our results, we urge that published literature state explicitly whether instantaneous counts were made and that survey procedures be accounted for when non-instantaneous counts are used. Using published density and biomass values of communities that include sharks we explore the effect of this bias and suggest that further investigation may be needed to determine pristine shark abundances and the existence of inverted biomass pyramids. Because such studies are used to make important management and conservation decisions, incorrect estimates of animal abundance and biomass have serious and significant implications.},

Second, I illustrate differences in these model selection tools by applying the four criteria to thousands of simulated abundance trajectories. With the simulation model known, I examine whether each of the criteria are useful in selecting models to evaluate simple questions, such as whether time series support evidence of density dependent population growth. Across simulations, the maximum likelihood criteria consistently favored simpler population models when compared to Bayesian criteria. Among the Bayesian criteria, the Bayes factor favored the correct simulation model more frequently than the Deviance Information Criterion. There was considerable uncertainty in the ability of the Bayes factor to discriminate between models, this tool selected the simulation model slightly more frequently than other approaches.},

Managers must understand the source (spatial distribution), efficiency, and behavior of angler effort in order to develop optimal management strategies in a social\textendash{}ecological framework. We interviewed anglers (n = 1,956) and assessed fish populations in 21 lakes that are part of a multistock, spatially structured fishery for Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the interior of British Columbia, Canada. Our objective was to assess the spatial behavior, harvest behavior, and catch efficiency of anglers and to understand the strengths of interactions between anglers and fish populations in three regions within this large fishery. Our results suggest a diverse angler population that varied in its behavior and its impact on the fishery. Using a hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified four distinct angler groups based on three variables that directly described how anglers interacted with the fishery (spatial distribution, catchability, and harvest behavior). Angler characteristics varied between groups, and the relative proportions of the four discrete angler groups varied among management regions. Substantial variation in angler characteristics across groups and variation in the relative distribution of the groups across regions imply that a ``one size fits all'' management approach is not optimal for this fishery. Instead, strategies that are attuned to angler characteristics would constitute a better approach for managing this large, spatially structured fishery.

  abstract = {Most population models and stock assessment approaches assume that fish and fishing are spatially uniform. Here, we examine the effects of spatial structure on fishery selection (selectivity). Selectivity refers to the fact that age- or size-classes of fish are not equally vulnerable to fishing; such differences in class-specific vulnerabilities will influence the age-structure of a fish stock, which in turn will determine the stock's productivity and ability to sustain harvest. The selectivity of the gear produces a characteristic selection curve that is generally assumed to be asymptotic. However, population-level selection curves can deviate considerably from an asymptotic shape given spatial structure in the population. For example, given time-invariant recruitment and time-invariant age-specific survival, the shape of the selection curve at the level of the population will be dome-shaped under a wide range of conditions, even though the gear-selection curves operating in common in all areas within the population are asymptotic. This paper explores the factors, under equilibrium conditions, influencing the areas-as-fleets selection curves that result from using selectivity coefficients to represent spatial catch-at-age in a non-spatial population dynamics model. We use a simplified set of survival equations from Sampson and Scott (Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68 (2011) 1077\textendash{}1086), in which there are three distinct spatial regions with the same asymptotic selection curve operating in each region, and show that while the overall population-selectivity is typically dome shaped, the corresponding areas-as-fleets selection curve shapes differ from each other and from the population-selection and gear-selection curves. Factors that influence how much the selectivity curves differ from each other include the magnitude of the differences in the regional fishing mortality rates, the rates of fish movement and whether the movements are diffusive or directional, and the regional distribution of the recruits. If fish movement rates are relatively slow (say, less than 20\% per time-step), then in nearly all cases areas-as-fleets selectivity will differ from the underlying gear-selectivity, except under the extraordinary conditions of equal recruitment and equal fishing mortality across all spatial regions.},

Three experiments were conducted to examine the effects of fish density, sampling effort, and the speed of fish in relation to the observer. Fish density and sampling effort did not significantly bias estimates of fish density using either census method, and variation was a function of the area sampled with both methods. The speed at which fish approached the diver caused appreciable bias with the transect method but not with the point count method, because of underlying assumptions about how the two methods were implemented. Performance of methods was quantified with the root mean squared error RMSE (combined measure of bias and variability) and was dependent on the ratio of sampling times per dive for each method. From assumed sampling times for the point count and transect methods, the point count method performed better than the transect method, but different results could be obtained under different sampling protocols. Nevertheless, the simulation approach offers an efficient means to evaluate sampling methods in conjunction with actual field experiments.},

Many fisheries are not assessed by standard stock assessment methods including many in the world's most biodiverse areas. Though simpler methods using widely available catch data are available, these are often discounted largely because data on fishing effort that contributed to the changes in catches are mostly not considered. We analyse spatial and temporal patterns of global fishing effort and its relationship with catch to assess the status of the world's fisheries. The study reveals that fleets now fish all of the world's oceans and have increased in power by an average of 10-fold (25-fold for Asia) since the 1950s. Significantly, for the equivalent fishing power expended, landings from global fisheries are now half what they were a half-century ago, indicating profound changes to supporting marine environments. This study provides another dimension to understand the global status of fisheries.},

These `catch transects' show where catch is extracted in the water column and near the sea bottom on plots of log-bathymetry versus log-distance offshore and thus allow for representation of the catch density of pelagic and benthic fisheries. Hence, they also allow direct visual comparison of the intensity of fishing through time and space. The California Current, North Sea and the South China Sea LMEs and the EEZs of Australia, Canada, Chile, China, India and Thailand are presented as examples, revealing the general intensification and extension of fishing offshore and into the depths over the decades from the 1950s. Catch transects reveal how these trends have accelerated in some areas, but surprisingly have reversed themselves in some others. It is proposed that these catch transects will be particularly useful for communicating the results of large-scale fisheries studies to a wide spectrum of groups ranging from the fishing industry to the general public.},

Our results illustrate how incrementally each year, marine foods are sourced farther from where they are consumed and moreover, require an increasing proportion of the ocean's primary productivity that underpins all marine life. Though mariculture supports increased consumption of seafood, it continues to require feeds based on fully exploited wild stocks. Here we examine the ocean's ability to meet our future demands to 2100 and find that even with mariculture supplementing near-static wild catches our growing needs are unlikely to be met without significant changes.},

Under the strategic goal to ``improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species, and genetic diversity,'' Target 11 aims to put 17\% of terrestrial and 10\% of marine regions under PA status by 2020. Additionally and crucially, these areas are required to be of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative, and well-connected and to include ``other effective area-based conservation measures'' (OECMs). Whereas the area-based targets are explicit and measurable, the lack of guidance for what constitutes important and representative; effective; and OECMs is affecting how nations are implementing the target. There is a real risk that Target 11 may be achieved in terms of area while failing the overall strategic goal for which it is established because the areas are poorly located, inadequately managed, or based on unjustifiable inclusion of OECMs. We argue that the conservation science community can help establish ecologically sensible PA targets to help prioritize important biodiversity areas and achieve ecological representation; identify clear, comparable performance metrics of ecological effectiveness so progress toward these targets can be assessed; and identify metrics and report on the contribution OECMs make toward the target. By providing ecologically sensible targets and new performance metrics for measuring the effectiveness of both PAs and OECMs, the science community can actively ensure that the achievement of the required area in Target 11 is not simply an end in itself but generates genuine benefits for biodiversity.},

To fully understand these patterns, it is necessary to identify where the benefits accumulate, how balanced the arrangements are, and how the pattern is evolving over time. Here the flow of global seafood was traced from locations of capture or production to their countries of consumption using novel approaches and databases. Results indicate an increasing dominance of Asian fleets by the volume of catch from the 1950s to the 2010s, including fishing in the high seas. The majority of landings were by high-income countries' fishing fleets in their own waters in the 1950s but this pattern was greatly altered by the 2010s, with more equality in landings volume and value by fleets representing different income levels. Results also show that the higher the income of a country, the more valuable seafood it imports compared to its exports and vice versa. In theory, this implies that the lower income countries are exporting high value seafood in part to achieve the broader goal of ending poverty, while achieving the food security goal by retaining and importing lower value seafood. In the context of access arrangements between developed and developing countries, the results allow insights into the consequences of these shifting sources of income may have for goals such as poverty reduction and food security.},

The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks.

In this paper we describe a substantial extension of Marxan called Marxan with Zones, a decision support tool that provides land-use zoning options in geographical regions for biodiversity conservation. We describe new functions designed to enhance the original Marxan software and expand on its utility as a decision support tool. The major new element in the decision problem is allowing any parcel of land or sea to be allocated to a specific zone, not just reserved or unreserved. Each zone then has the option of its own actions, objectives and constraints, with the flexibility to define the contribution of each zone to achieve targets for pre-specified features (e.g. species or habitats). The objective is to minimize the total cost of implementing the zoning plan while ensuring a variety of conservation and land-use objectives are achieved. We outline the capabilities, limitations and additional data requirements of this new software and perform a comparison with the original version of Marxan. We feature a number of case studies to demonstrate the functionality of the software and highlight its flexibility to address a range of complex spatial planning problems. These studies demonstrate the design of multiple-use marine parks in both Western Australia and California, and the zoning of forest use in East Kalimantan.},

A harvest control rule that incorporates limit and target fishing mortality levels is used to calculate the following year's intended fishing mortality based on the estimate of FCUR. This is then used to adjust a reference catch to calculate the following year's recommended catch. The performance of this new harvest strategy in relation to defined management objectives is tested by management strategy evaluation for two example species with different life-history characteristics. The simulation results show that a harvest strategy using equilibrium assessment methods such as catch-curves can perform reasonably well when used in combination with an appropriate catch averaging period, and a suitable harvest control rule.},

This is especially the case in climate change `hotspots' such as south-eastern Australia, where the rate of ocean-warming is 3\textendash{}4 times the global average. The application of harvest strategies utilizing biological reference points that do not take into account the effect of the changing environment on fish productivity may lead to unsustainable catch recommendations. Jackass morwong (Nemadactylus macropterus) is a moderately long-lived demersal species inhabiting continental shelf waters of the southern hemisphere. The most recent Stock Synthesis assessment for the species suggests that this stock has recently declined in abundance off south-eastern Australia. The stock assessment attributes the decline to mostly below average recruitment since 1985, but the recommended catch levels are based on an assumption of average recruitment from a stationary stock\textendash{}recruitment relationship. The ability of Stock Synthesis to include an environmental variable to adjust the stock\textendash{}recruitment relationship is used to model a regime shift on the average level of recruitment. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is then used to examine the consequences of using the wrong recruitment assumption in the assessment used in the harvest strategy for setting the catches. The MSE shows that the consequences of mis-specifying the assessment model are greater if the assessment continues to assume that no shift in recruitment has occurred. Thus the more precautionary approach for management wishing to meet all the aims of the Australian government Harvest Strategy Policy is to assume that a shift in recruitment has occurred. A possible mechanism for how observed oceanic changes could be impacting jackass morwong recruitment is presented.},

  abstract = {Despite longstanding recognition that small-scale fisheries make multiple contributions to economies, societies and cultures, assessing these contributions and incorporating them into policy and decision-making has suffered from a lack of a comprehensive integrating `lens'. This paper focuses on the concept of `wellbeing' as a means to accomplish this integration, thereby unravelling and better assessing complex social and economic issues within the context of fisheries governance. We emphasize the relevance of the three key components of wellbeing \textendash{} the material, relational and subjective dimensions, each of which is relevant to wellbeing at scales ranging from individual, household, community, fishery to human-ecological systems as a whole. We review nine major approaches influential in shaping current thinking and practice on wellbeing: the economics of happiness, poverty, capabilities, gender, human rights, sustainable livelihoods, vulnerability, social capital, and social wellbeing. The concept of identity is a thread that runs through the relational and subjective components of social wellbeing, as well as several other approaches and thus emerges as a critical element of small-scale fisheries that requires explicit recognition in governance analysis. A social wellbeing lens is applied to critically review a global body of literature discussing the social, economic and political dimensions of small-scale fishing communities, seeking to understand the relevance and value addition of applying wellbeing concepts in small-scale fisheries.},

For the oceans, the overall aim is to establish, by 2012, an effectively managed, representative, global system of marine protected areas (MPAs) covering 10\% of all marine ecological regions, comprising both multiple use areas and strictly protected areas. An analysis of data for three countries in Eastern Africa, where considerable efforts to promote MPAs by many agencies have been made over the past decade, shows that rapid progress has been made towards achieving this target. Since the first MPAs were established in the 1960s and 1970s, 8.7\% of the continental shelf in Kenya, 8.1\% in Tanzania and 4.0\% in Mozambique has been designated, with the size of recently protected sites markedly larger than earlier sites. Commitments to expand the MPA networks in these countries would, if implemented, largely achieve the 10\% coverage target. The location of existing marine protected areas shows good correlation with known sites of high species diversity; and coral reefs and Important Bird Areas are well represented. Management effectiveness of MPAs is also improving. However, there are major constraints to meeting the MPA target in these countries. Many habitats and species are not yet fully represented, the area closed to fishing is less than the recommended 20\textendash{}30\%, and capacity building is needed to improve many aspects of management. Furthermore, despite considerable investment in monitoring of coral reefs and other coastal habitats, the data available do not show clearly whether biodiversity and socio-economic objectives are being met. Although East African countries need to be congratulated for their vision, the results thus far indicate the urgency of both improving monitoring systems for measuring progress towards the targets, and also taking further steps to expand and improve management of existing MPAs.},

  abstract = {Abstract The utility of individual based models (IBMs) is that properties of ecological systems can be derived by considering the properties of individuals constituting them. Individual differences may be physiological, behavioral or may arise from interactions among individuals. The differences result in unique life histories, which when considered as a whole give rise to growth and size distributions that provide a measure of the state of the population. Early IBMs generally did not consider the effect of a spatially variable physical environment. Recent advances in ocean circulation models that include realistic temporal and spatial variation of currents, turbulence, light, prey, etc., have enabled IBMs to be embedded in model flow fields and for unique, sometimes behaviorally modified, Lagrangian trajectories to be computed. The explicit consideration of realistic spatial heterogeneity provides an additional factor that contributes to the differentiation among individuals, to variances in population structure, and ultimately to our understanding of the recruitment process. This is particularly important in marine environments where fronts, boundary layers, pycnoclines, gyres and other smaller spatial features have been hypothesized to play a significant role in determining vital rates and population structure. In this paper we will review the status of research on spatially-explicit IBMs, their successes, limitations and future developments. Examples will be drawn from approaches used in the past decade in GLOBEC, FOCI, SABRE and other programs.},

Harvest limits for previously un-assessed U.S. west coast groundfish have been set using catch-only methods (Depletion Corrected Average Catch [DCAC] and Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis [DB-SRA]) for data-limited stocks, as well as catch and index based methods (Extended Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis [XDB-SRA] and Extended Simple Stock Synthesis [XSSS]) for data-moderate stocks. To account for uncertainty and to prevent overfishing the harvest levels for U.S. west coast groundfish are reduced based upon the estimation method and the amount of data used. A management strategy evaluation was applied to evaluate the performance of each estimation method to provide benchmark harvest levels for two life-history types (U.S. west coast flatfish and rockfish) under varying misspecifications of the parameter distributions used by these methods. Both, data-moderate and catch-only (data-limited) methods, resulted in overfishing \&gt; 0.50 (except XSSS in select scenarios) when the simulated stock was below the relative biomass target for both life-histories. Each of the data-moderate methods (XDB-SRA and XSSS) that applied biomass index data failed to estimate the correct stock status in the first assessment when an overly optimistic prior distribution about the stock status was assumed. However, during the projection period as the biomass index lengthened, the estimates of current stock size improved for both of these estimation methods, reducing the probability of overfishing to \&lt;0.50 (except XSSS for one scenario). The ability to incorporate index data by the data-moderate methods resulted in improved estimates, as the data became more informative, for stock status and the subsequent harvest limits, that when reduced to account for uncertainty resulted in population stock sizes that either remain stable or rebuild toward the biomass targets for both life-histories. A notable exception was the performance of XDB-SRA for the flatfish life-history when the stock was at the target level and the prior was assumed correctly. In this instance the index data were non-informative, resulting in overfishing due to overly optimistic estimates of relative population size.},

  abstract = {Lively debate continues over whether marine reserves can lead to increased fishery yields when compared to conventional, quota-based management, apparently driven by differences in the complexity and biological richness of the models being used. In an influential article, Hastings and Botsford used an analytically tractable, spatially implicit, non-age-structured model to assert that reserves are typically incapable of increasing yields relative to conventional management, regardless of the type (pre- or post-dispersal, involving adults and/or larvae) or functional form (Ricker or Beverton-Holt) of density dependence present. A recent numerical (simulation) model by Gaylord et al. concludes that reserves can enhance yield compared to conventional management, a result the authors attribute to their spatially-explicit evaluation of stage-structured adult growth, survivability and fecundity; and intercohort (adult-on-larvae) post-dispersal density dependent population dynamics. Here we demonstrate that the increased model complexity is not responsible for the different conclusions. We analyze a spatially-implicit model without stage structure that incorporates intercohort post-dispersal density dependence. In this simple model we still find annual extirpation of adult populations outside reserves due to fishing to enhance larval recruitment there, allowing for increased yields compared to those achieved when harvest is evenly spread across the entire domain under conventional management. Consideration of neither spatially-explicit dispersal dynamics nor stage-structure in adult demographics is required for reserves to substantially improve yield beyond that attainable under conventional management. In contrast, consideration of within cohort post-dispersal density dependence among larva during settlement in an otherwise identical model generates equivalence in yield between the two management strategies. These results recast a common message characterizing the relative benefit of reserve versus non-reserve management from ``equivalence at best'' to ``potentially improved''.},

However, the economic performance of fisheries depends on economic profit, not fish yield. The predictions of higher yields with reserves rely on intensive fishing pressures between reserves; the exorbitant costs of harvesting low-density populations erode profits. We incorporated this effect into a bioeconomic model to evaluate the economic performance of reserve-based management. Our results indicate that reserves can still benefit fisheries, even those targeting species that are expensive to harvest. However, in contrast to studies focused on yield, only a moderate proportion of the coast in reserves (with moderate harvest pressures outside reserves) is required to maximize profit. Furthermore, reserve area and harvest intensity can be traded off with little impact on profits, allowing for management flexibility while still providing higher profit than attainable under conventional management.},

However, efficiency gains erode when delineation of spatial rights constitutes incomplete ownership of the resource, thereby degrading its local value and promoting overexploitation. Incomplete ownership may be particularly prevalent in the spatial management of mobile fishery species. We developed a game-theoretic bioeconomic model of spatial property rights representing territorial user rights fisheries (TURF) management of nearshore marine fish and invertebrate species with mobile adult and larval life history stages. Strategic responses by fisheries in neighboring management units result in overexploitation of the stock and reduced yields for each fishery compared with those attainable without resource mobility or with coordination or sole control in fishing effort. High dispersal potential of the larval stage, a common trait among nearshore fishery species, coupled with scaling of management units to only capture adult mobility, a common characteristic of many nearshore TURF programs, in particular substantially reduced stock levels and yields. In a case study of hypothetical TURF programs of nearshore fish and invertebrate species, management units needed to be tens of kilometers in alongshore length to minimize larval export and generate reasonable returns to fisheries. Cooperation and quota regulations represent solutions to the problem that need to be quantified in cost and integrated into the determination of the acceptability of spatial property rights management of fisheries.},

Using simulated larval dispersal estimates based on ocean current observations, we demonstrate how explicit consideration of frequency of exchange of larvae among sites via ocean advection can fundamentally change the interpretation of empirical population genetic structuring as compared with conventional spatial genetic analyses. Both frequency of larval exchange and empirical genetic difference were uncorrelated with Euclidean distance between sites. When transformed into relative oceanographic distances and integrated into a genetic isolation-by-distance framework, however, the frequency of larval exchange explained nearly 50 per cent of the variance in empirical genetic differences among sites over scales of tens of kilometres. Explanatory power was strongest when we considered effects of multiple generations of larval dispersal via intermediary locations on the long-term probability of exchange between sites. Our results uncover meaningful spatial patterning to population genetic structuring that corresponds with ocean circulation. This study advances our ability to interpret population structure from complex genetic data characteristic of high gene flow species, validates recent advances in oceanographic approaches for assessing larval dispersal and represents a novel approach to characterize population connectivity at small spatial scales germane to conservation and fisheries management.},

  abstract = {Coral and rocky reef fish populations are widely used as model systems for the experimental exploration of density-dependent vital rates, but patterns of density-dependent mortality in these systems are not yet fully understood. In particular, the paradigm for strong, directly density-dependent (DDD) postsettlement mortality stands in contrast to recent evidence for inversely density-dependent (IDD) mortality. We review the processes responsible for DDD and IDD per capita mortality in reef fishes, noting that the pattern observed depends on predator and prey behavior, the spatial configuration of the reef habitat, and the spatial and temporal scales of observation. Specifically, predators tend to produce DDD prey mortality at their characteristic spatial scale of foraging, but prey mortality is IDD at smaller spatial scales due to attack-abatement effects (e.g., risk dilution). As a result, DDD mortality may be more common than IDD mortality on patch reefs, which tend to constrain predator foraging to the same scale as prey aggregation, eliminating attack-abatement effects. Additionally, adjacent groups of prey on continuous reefs may share a subset of refuges, increasing per capita refuge availability and relaxing DDD mortality relative to prey on patch reefs, where the patch edge could prevent such refuge sharing. These hypotheses lead to a synthetic framework to predict expected mortality patterns for a variety of scenarios. For nonsocial, nonaggregating species and species that aggregate in order to take advantage of spatially clumped refuges, IDD mortality is possible but likely superseded by DDD refuge competition, especially on patch reefs. By contrast, for species that aggregate socially, mortality should be IDD at the scale of individual aggregations but DDD at larger scales. The results of nearly all prior reef fish studies fit within this framework, although additional work is needed to test many of the predicted outcomes. This synthesis reconciles some apparent contradictions in the recent reef fish literature and suggests the importance of accounting for the scale-sensitive details of predator and prey behavior in any study system.},

  abstract = {Marine protected areas (MPAs) are growing in popularity as a conservation tool, and there are increasing calls for additional MPAs. Meta-analyses indicate that most MPAs successfully meet the minimal goal of increasing biomass inside the MPA, while some do not, leaving open the important question of what makes MPAs successful. An often-overlooked aspect of this problem is that the success of fishery management outside MPA boundaries (i.e., whether a population is overfished) affects how well MPAs meet both conservation goals (e.g., increased biomass) and economic goals (e.g., minimal negative effects on fishery yield). Using a simple example of a system with homogeneous habitat and periodically spaced MPAs, we show that, as area in MPAs increases, (1) conservation value (biomass) may initially be zero, implying no benefit, then at some point increases monotonically; and (2) fishery yield may be zero, then increases monotonically to a maximum beyond which further increase in MPA area causes yield to decline. Importantly, the points at which these changes in slope occur vary among species and depend on management outside MPAs. Decision makers considering the effects of a potential system of MPAs on multiple species are confronted by a number of such cost\textendash{}benefit curves, and it is usually impossible to maximize benefits and minimize costs for all species. Moreover, the precise shape of each curve is unknown due to uncertainty regarding the fishery status of each species. Here we describe a decision-analytic approach that incorporates existing information on fishery stock status to present decision makers with the range of likely outcomes of MPA implementation. To summarize results from many species whose overfishing status is uncertain, our decision-analysis approach involves weighted averages over both overfishing uncertainty and species. In an example from an MPA decision process in California, USA, an optimistic projection of future fishery management success led to recommendation of fewer and smaller MPAs than that derived from a more pessimistic projection of future management success. This example illustrates how information on fishery status can be used to project potential outcomes of MPA implementation within a decision analysis framework and highlights the need for better population information.},

  abstract = {No-take marine reserves are an increasingly popular conservation and management tool. Assessing reserve performance in an adaptive management framework ideally involves predicting the response of populations and communities to reserves (typically in the design process) and testing predicted outcomes against observations. Here we compare existing modeling and empirical studies on no-take marine reserves, and provide a prospectus for their future integration. Numerical models of ecological responses to reserves typically project long-term, steady-state interactions over the relatively broad spatial scales of larval dispersal, reserve configuration, fishing effort, and fish movement. Existing empirical studies focus on short-term outcomes over small scales, typically aggregated over many explanatory factors. Linking models and empirical data together for the adaptive management of marine reserves requires adjusting the spatial and temporal scales of models to match empirically feasible tests, and adjusting the metrics and scale of empirical studies to account for the interacting biological and human factors affecting reserve outcomes.},

  abstract = {Marine spatial planning (MSP) is an emerging responsibility of resource managers around the United States and elsewhere. A key proposed advantage of MSP is that it makes tradeoffs in resource use and sector (stakeholder group) values explicit, but doing so requires tools to assess tradeoffs. We extended tradeoff analyses from economics to simultaneously assess multiple ecosystem services and the values they provide to sectors using a robust, quantitative, and transparent framework. We used the framework to assess potential conflicts among offshore wind energy, commercial fishing, and whale-watching sectors in Massachusetts and identify and quantify the value from choosing optimal wind farm designs that minimize conflicts among these sectors. Most notably, we show that using MSP over conventional planning could prevent {$>\$$}1 million dollars in losses to the incumbent fishery and whale-watching sectors and could generate {$>\$$}10 billion in extra value to the energy sector. The value of MSP increased with the greater the number of sectors considered and the larger the area under management. Importantly, the framework can be applied even when sectors are not measured in dollars (e.g., conservation). Making tradeoffs explicit improves transparency in decision-making, helps avoid unnecessary conflicts attributable to perceived but weak tradeoffs, and focuses debate on finding the most efficient solutions to mitigate real tradeoffs and maximize sector values. Our analysis demonstrates the utility, feasibility, and value of MSP and provides timely support for the management transitions needed for society to address the challenges of an increasingly crowded ocean environment.},

  abstract = {Ecology Letters (2012)AbstractCoordinating decisions and actions among interacting sectors is a critical component of ecosystem-based management, but uncertainty about coordinated management's effects is compromising its perceived value and use. We constructed an analytical framework for explicitly calculating how coordination affects management decisions, ecosystem state and the provision of ecosystem services in relation to ecosystem dynamics and socio-economic objectives. The central insight is that the appropriate comparison strategy to optimal coordinated management is optimal uncoordinated management, which can be identified at the game theoretic Nash equilibrium. Using this insight we can calculate coordination's effects in relation to uncoordinated management and other reference scenarios. To illustrate how this framework can help identify ecosystem and socio-economic conditions under which coordination is most influential and valuable, we applied it to a heuristic case study and a simulation model for the California Current Marine Ecosystem. Results indicate that coordinated management can more than double an ecosystem's societal value, especially when sectors can effectively manipulate resources that interact strongly. However, societal gains from coordination will need to be reconciled with observations that it also leads to strategic simplification of the ecological food web, and generates both positive and negative impacts on individual sectors and non-target species.},

  abstract = {Fishing pressure has increased the extinction risk of many elasmobranch (shark and ray) species. Although many countries have established no-take marine reserves, a paucity of monitoring data means it is still unclear if reserves are effectively protecting these species. We examined data collected by a small group of divers over the past 21 years at one of the world's oldest marine protected areas (MPAs), Cocos Island National Park, Costa Rica. We used mixed effects models to determine trends in relative abundance, or probability of occurrence, of 12 monitored elasmobranch species while accounting for variation among observers and from abiotic factors. Eight of 12 species declined significantly over the past 2 decades. We documented decreases in relative abundance for 6 species, including the iconic scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) (-45\%), whitetip reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) (-77\%), mobula ray (Mobula spp.) (-78\%), and manta ray (Manta birostris) (-89\%), and decreases in the probability of occurrence for 2 other species. Several of these species have small home ranges and should be better protected by an MPA, which underscores the notion that declines of marine megafauna will continue unabated in MPAs unless there is adequate enforcement effort to control fishing. In addition, probability of occurrence at Cocos Island of tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis), blacktip (Carcharhinus limbatus), and whale (Rhincodon typus) sharks increased significantly. The effectiveness of MPAs cannot be evaluated by examining single species because population responses can vary depending on life history traits and vulnerability to fishing pressure.},

  abstract = {1 The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57\% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2 The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3 We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing significant predictors to be obtained from each year's data. In spite of the significance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4 An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identifies large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

  abstract = {For federally managed fisheries in the USA, National Standard 1 requires that an acceptable biological catch be set for all fisheries and that this catch avoid overfishing. Achieving this goal for data-poor stocks, for which stock assessments are not possible, is particularly challenging. A number of harvest control rules have very recently been developed to set sustainable catches in data-poor fisheries, but the ability of most of these rules to avoid overfishing has not been tested. We conducted a management strategy evaluation to assess several control rules proposed for data-poor situations. We examined three general life histories (``slow,'' ``medium,'' and ``fast'') and three exploitation histories (under-, fully, and overexploited) to identify control rules that balance the competing objectives of avoiding overfishing and maintaining high levels of harvest. Many of the control rules require information on species life history and relative abundance, so we explored a scenario in which unbiased knowledge was used in the control rule and one in which highly inflated estimates of stock biomass were used. Our analyses showed that no single control rule performed well across all scenarios, with those that performed well in the unbiased scenario performing poorly in the biased scenarios and vice versa. Only the most conservative data-poor control rules limited the probability of overfishing across most of the life history and exploitation scenarios explored, but these rules typically required very conservative catches under the unbiased scenarios.

The most common rights-based system is the individual transferable quota that grants fishermen rights to a share of a biologically determined total harvest. Another rights-based system is the harvester cooperative that grants access rights to a group. Unlike these species-based rights systems, territorial use rights fisheries, known as TURFs, are place-based, allocating some or all resources within a designated coastal zone to one or more agents. This article discusses the deficiencies of species-based systems and the advantages of place-based systems and reviews experience with TURFs in Japan and Chile. We argue that the success of TURFs depends not only on their physical design and placement, but also on the governing institutions that make internal resource use decisions. In most applications, TURFs are governed by harvester cooperatives that generate value by mitigating common property incentives and resolving internal coordination problems not otherwise addressed by species-based instruments.

The majority of the evidence supporting such expectations still involves comparisons of abundance at the one time of sites with and without marine reserve protection. Very few studies have data on the abundance and size structure of species targeted by fisheries in an area before reserve status is applied. Quantitative estimates of density and biomass of coral trout, Plectropomus spp., the major target of the hook and line fisheries on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, on inshore fringing reefs of the Palm and Whitsunday Island groups, central GBR, are provided for 3\textendash{}4 years before (1983\textendash{}1984), and 12\textendash{}13 years after (1999\textendash{}2000) the establishment of no-take reserves in 1987. Quantitative estimates of density and biomass of coral trout in areas open to fishing were also collected in 1999\textendash{}2000 at these two island groups. Density and biomass of coral trout increased significantly (by factors of 5.9 and 6.3 in the Palm Islands, and 4.0 and 6.2 in the Whitsunday Islands) in the reserve sites, but not the fished sites, between 1983\textendash{}1984 and 1999\textendash{}2000. In 1999\textendash{}2000, density and biomass of coral trout and a secondary target of the fisheries, Lutjanus carponotatus, were significantly higher in the protected zones than in the fished zones at both island groups. The density and biomass of non-target fish species (Labridae, Siganidae and Chaetodontidae) did not differ significantly between reserve and fished zones at either island group. This is the most convincing data to date that the management zoning of the world's largest marine park has been effective, at least for coral trout on inshore reefs.},

L{\'a}jer's warning against non-random sampling in the field is well taken, but non-randomization is probably more common than we realize in experimental work too, and a frequent cause of inexplicable ``significant'' results. However, in the placement of quadrats/samples, restricted randomization is always preferable to plain random. The main purpose of randomization, as R.A. Fisher made clear, is to obtain a valid estimate of the error. Random placement does not, as Fisher realized, ensure independence of samples because of spatial autocorrelation, which is present in all ecological work. If we forget this, we can end up concluding that elephants carefully select moss cushions to tread on. Although a normal distribution is often formally required, tests such as the Analysis of Variance are fairly robust against departures. Obsession with normality leads to the use of inappropriate transformations, for example a log transformation when the author had no intention of a multiplicative model. Even worse is the use of a log (x + 1) transformation, which gives answers in neither additive nor multiplicative terms, and in a way unrelated to the means presented. There are several solutions to this, including randomization tests. After all this, we should not take the arbitrary value of 0.05 too seriously. Many statisticians do not.},

We develop a framework for integrating marine reserves into two data-limited assessment models: spawning potential ratio (SPR) and yield per recruit (YPR). We use Monte Carlo simulation to test the applicability of the framework to a sedentary species with a dispersive larval stage under process and observation uncertainties. The reserve-based approach increased estimates of spawning potential while reducing YPR and had a consistent estimation bias of less than 15\%. Using the framework, we assessed a commercial fishery targeting grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger) in southern California, USA and found that inclusion of reserves reduced the probability of overfishing. The reserve-based assessment approach may create win\textendash{}win policy solutions for conservation and fisheries objectives in many nearshore fisheries with well-enforced marine reserves that target sedentary species with a dispersive larval stage.},

JABBA can be used for biomass dynamic stock assessment applications, and has emerged from the development of a Bayesian State-Space Surplus Production Model framework, already applied in stock assessments of sharks, tuna, and billfishes around the world. JABBA presents a unifying, flexible framework for biomass dynamic modelling, runs quickly, and generates reproducible stock status estimates and diagnostic tools. Specific emphasis has been placed on flexibility for specifying alternative scenarios, achieving high stability and improved convergence rates. Default JABBA features include: 1) an integrated state-space tool for averaging and automatically fitting multiple catch per unit effort (CPUE) time series; 2) data-weighting through estimation of additional observation variance for individual or grouped CPUE; 3) selection of Fox, Schaefer, or Pella-Tomlinson production functions; 4) options to fix or estimate process and observation variance components; 5) model diagnostic tools; 6) future projections for alternative catch regimes; and 7) a suite of inbuilt graphics illustrating model fit diagnostics and stock status results. As a case study, JABBA is applied to the 2017 assessment input data for South Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius). We envision that JABBA will become a widely used, open-source stock assessment tool, readily improved and modified by the global scientific community.},

California spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) support commercial and recreational fishing in southern California; however, we lack basic information to determine whether MPAs planned for the region will enhance abundance. Working within and outside a small southern California MPA, we (1) quantified the movement patterns and home ranges of the lobster over two time scales, (2) determined lobster day and night habitat associations and (3) determined habitat-specific predation risk. Lobsters exhibited high site fidelity and small home ranges (geometric mean of 651~m2 and 5912~m2 per week, on the basis of 50\% and 95\% kernel utilisation distributions, respectively). Lobsters were associated with rocky habitat during the day and with the red algae Plocamium cartilagineum while feeding at night. Relative survival rates of lobsters were high across vegetated and unvegetated habitats at night, and were highest in surfgrass (Phyllopsadix torreyi) habitat during the day. Our results highlight the need to consider how movement patterns vary over short and long time scales, and how habitat use may vary from day to night for nocturnally active species such as lobsters, when planning MPAs.},

However, this evaluation is not straightforward because various data types (acoustic backscatter, length, weight, and age composition) are combined to produce estimates of abundance- and biomass-at-age. Uncertainties associated with each data type and those from functional relationships among variables need to be evaluated and combined. Uncertainty due to spatial sampling is evaluated using geostatistical conditional (co-) simulations. Multiple realizations of acoustic backscatter were produced using transformed Gaussian simulations with a Gibbs sampler to handle zeros. Multiple realizations of length frequency distributions were produced using transformed multivariate Gaussian co-simulations derived from quantiles of the empirical length distributions. Uncertainty due to errors in functional relationships was evaluated using bootstrap for the target strength-at-length and the weight-at-length relationships and for age\textendash{}length keys. The contribution of each of these major sources of uncertainty was assessed for acoustic-trawl surveys of walleye pollock in the eastern Bering Sea in 2006\textendash{}2010. This simulation framework allows a general computation for estimating abundance- and biomass-at-age variance\textendash{}covariance matrices. Such estimates suggest that the covariance structure assumed in fitting stock assessment models differs substantially from what careful analysis of survey data actually indicate.},

Despite the abundance, ubiquity, and ecological importance of parasites, it is unknown whether the same decoupling effects occur for parasitic species. We investigated the influence of fishing on the relationship between host diversity and parasite diversity for parasites of coral reef fishes on three fished and three unfished islands in the central equatorial Pacific. Fishing was associated with a shallowing of the positive host-diversity\textendash{}parasite-diversity relationship. This occurred primarily through negative impacts of fishing on the presence of complex life-cycle parasites, which created a biologically impoverished parasite fauna of directly transmitted parasites resilient to changes in host biodiversity. Parasite diversity appears to be decoupled from host diversity by fishing impacts in this coral reef ecosystem, which suggests that such decoupling might also occur for parasites in other ecosystems affected by environmental change.},

Overall, rates of resource collapse increased and recovery potential, stability, and water quality decreased exponentially with declining diversity. Restoration of biodiversity, in contrast, increased productivity fourfold and decreased variability by 21\%, on average. We conclude that marine biodiversity loss is increasingly impairing the ocean's capacity to provide food, maintain water quality, and recover from perturbations.

  abstract = {Adequate conservation and management of shark populations is becoming increasingly important on a global scale, especially because many species are exceptionally vulnerable to overfishing. Yet, reported catch statistics for sharks are incomplete, and mortality estimates have not been available for sharks as a group. Here, the global catch and mortality of sharks from reported and unreported landings, discards, and shark finning are being estimated at 1.44 million metric tons for the year 2000, and at only slightly less in 2010 (1.41 million tons). Based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year. Further, the exploitation rate for sharks as a group was calculated by dividing two independent mortality estimates by an estimate of total global biomass. As an alternative approach, exploitation rates for individual shark populations were compiled and averaged from stock assessments and other published sources. The resulting three independent estimates of the average exploitation rate ranged between 6.4\% and 7.9\% of sharks killed per year. This exceeds the average rebound rate for many shark populations, estimated from the life history information on 62 shark species (rebound rates averaged 4.9\% per year), and explains the ongoing declines in most populations for which data exist. The consequences of these unsustainable catch and mortality rates for marine ecosystems could be substantial. Global total shark mortality, therefore, needs to be reduced drastically in order to rebuild depleted populations and restore marine ecosystems with functional top predators.},

The theoretical model is illustrated with analysis of the Nha Trang Bay (NTB) MPA in Khanh Hoa province in Vietnam, where the anchovy purse seine fishery is considered. An amenity value function of the NTB MPA is estimated from a discrete choice experiment among national tourists. A weighting parameter is added to the bioeconomic model to allow the establishment of a tradeoff between management preferences regarding the two sectors affected by the MPA, fisheries and tourism. Both the theoretical models and the empirical application show how the added amenity values affect optimal fishing practices as well as the identification of the optimal MPA size. Our applied analysis shows that contrary to the argument in most MPA studies with multiple stakeholders, the current management practice in Khanh Hoa prioritizes the fisheries sector heavily compared to tourism, despite high economic cost.},

In this paper, a detailed examination of the pros and cons of the current system in Japan is compared to the current fishery management measures of Iceland and the United States, where attaining economically or biologically efficient outcomes may be prioritized in making fisheries management decisions. For many coastal fisheries in Japan, maintaining a management scheme in which stakeholders play an active role in determining fisheries measures seems more relevant if their priority is to maintain the stability of coastal communities and equity of stakeholders.

Initially, the program appeared to be a success, bringing order to the previous years' derbies. Ex-vessel prices rose, harvest stabilized, and there was an orderly shrinking of the fleet to an economically appropriate size. The subsequent history of the fishery is more complex. ITQ sales dwindled in 1995, then ceased for 13 years. Harvest plummeted to barely a tenth of the eligible quota, and in 2010 the fleet's quota was reduced 88\%. Was the wreckfish ITQ program a failure? We provide the first published analysis of the program in two decades. We examine the decisions of former participants to leave the fishery. We also examine the program's current economic, biological, and regulatory performance compared to the program's original stated goals and the goals associated with ITQs in the literature.

An analysis of previous data was carried out, consisting of a non-linear cross-correlation analysis to estimate the time lags for each input variable. A multi-layer perceptron architecture model was used, calibrated with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, thus obtaining anchovy landings and sardine CPUE forecast models. An ecosystemic approach was conducted for both models, considering local and global environmental variables, the anthropogenic effect, and the interaction between species as inputs. The variance explained by both models was slightly higher than 82\% and the standard error of prediction was lower than 45\%. The strong correlation between the estimated and observed series on the anchovy and sardine models suggests that ANN models capture the trend of the historical data. Furthermore, the generalization capacity along with the sensitivity analysis allowed the identification of high-weight variables in the model, as well as the partial interpretation of the statistical functional relationships between the input variables and the abundance.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Six groundfish species were considered: Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus), Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus), northern rock sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra), and southern rock sole (Lepidopsetta bilineata). Ontogenetic differences were examined by dividing data for each fish species into size classes. Our study demonstrated that after accounting for size-specific depth preferences, the spatial responses of groundfish to anomalous ocean conditions differed by species and foraging guild in the central Gulf of Alaska. Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder showed similar responses to ocean warming, but different responses to cooling. In general, Pacific cod moved to deeper depths in warmer years and moved to shallower depths in colder years. Arrowtooth flounder also moved deeper in warmer years. However, in colder years, large arrowtooth flounder ({$>$}40 cm) shifted toward shallower depths while smaller-sized fish shifted toward deeper depths. In warmer years, large pollock ({$>$}30 cm) moved to deeper waters while smaller pollock (10\textendash{}20 cm) moved to shallower waters. Pacific ocean perch exhibited an opposite response to thermal changes in habitat compared with Pacific cod and arrowtooth flounder. They moved deeper in colder years, but there was no clear change in depth as a function of size in response to warmer habitat.},

  abstract = {Marine capture fisheries are of global importance, supporting hundreds of millions of livelihoods and making a significant contribution to global food security. Yet many fisheries are at risk from unsustainable exploitation and fishing has caused significant detrimental impacts on the wider marine environment. The success of initiatives to improve marine management depends, at least partly, on fisher behaviour and there is a growing recognition of the need for increased fisher participation in planning and management. This study focuses on fishers׳ perceptions and attitudes towards marine and fisheries management, and explores how that knowledge can be used to improve future management strategies. One hundred and six fishers took part in a semi-structured questionnaire and mapping exercise. Fishers proved to be keen to participate, were candid in their responses and, contrary to common perception, were not opposed to regulations and management. Indeed, they acknowledged both to be essential for the long-term viability of the fisheries, and they expressed a need for tighter controls and better enforcement. Fishers did however feel that some of the current regulations and management measures were unjust, they expressed frustration with how hard it was for fishers to participate in the management decision making processes, and they were concerned that their representatives were not representative of the industry as a whole. Fishers expressed mixed feelings on MPAs; nevertheless, over half the fishers interviewed suggested that areas should be protected, and many supported some form of spatial restriction on mobile fishing gear. Fishers also reported both spatial and behavioural changes in their fishing as a result of rising fuel prices. Improved communication between fishers and managers was identified as key for enhancing participation. This study highlights some of the ways in which fisher participation could lead to more effective long-term solutions to marine and fisheries management problems.},

The model describes the spatial-temporal dynamics of world fisheries very well with a pseudo R2 = 0.75 and estimates the effects of key drivers of fishery production. The results demonstrate the integrative operation of bottom-up and top-down regulated trophic interactions at the global level and great variations in their relative importance among different types of ecosystem. The estimation of key drivers' effects on marine ecosystems provides practical mechanisms for informed ecosystem-based fisheries management to achieve the sustainable objectives that are consistent with the needs of specific fisheries.},

  abstract = {Many of the world's fish stocks are depleted as a result of overexploitation, pollution and habitat loss. The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) sets a target for fisheries to maintain or restore stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) by 2015. We assessed the global stock status and found that 68\% were at or above the MSY level in 2008 and that the 2015 target is unlikely to be met. We compiled data for eight indicators to evaluate the sustainability of fisheries and the gap to meet the WSSD target. These indicators show that the overall condition of global fisheries is declining, long-term benefits are being compromised, and pressures on fisheries are increasing despite fisheries policy and management actions being taken by coastal States. We develop a bio-economic model to estimate the costs and benefits of restoring overfished stocks. Our results show that the global fishing capacity needs to be cut by 36\textendash{}43\% from the 2008 level, resulting in the loss of employment of 12\textendash{}15 million fishers and costing US\$96\textendash{}358 billion for buybacks. On the other hand, meeting the WSSD goal will increase annual fishery production by 16.5 million tonnes, annual rent by US\$32 billion and improve biodiversity and functioning of marine ecosystems. However, progress towards rebuilding has been hindered by an unwillingness or inability to accept the short-term socio-economic consequences associated with rebuilding fisheries. Thus, there is a pressing need for integration of rebuilding plans into national political and economic decision-making.},

Ecology concerns the behavior of complex, dynamic, interconnected systems of populations, communities, and ecosystems over time. Yet ecological time series can be relatively short, owing to practical limits on study duration. Ye and Sugihara introduce an analytical approach called multiview embedding, which harnesses the complexity of short, noisy time series that are common in ecology and other disciplines such as economics. Using examples from published data sets, they show how this approach enhances the tractability of complex data from multiple interacting components and offers a way forward in ecological forecasting.
Science, this issue p. 922
In ecological analysis, complexity has been regarded as an obstacle to overcome. Here we present a straightforward approach for addressing complexity in dynamic interconnected systems. We show that complexity, in the form of multiple interacting components, can actually be an asset for studying natural systems from temporal data. The central idea is that multidimensional time series enable system dynamics to be reconstructed from multiple viewpoints, and these viewpoints can be combined into a single model. We show how our approach, multiview embedding (MVE), can improve forecasts for simulated ecosystems and a mesocosm experiment. By leveraging complexity, MVE is particularly effective for overcoming the limitations of short and noisy time series and should be highly relevant for many areas of science.
Multiview embedding uses complexity as an asset for modeling interconnected systems for ecological forecasting.

In this paper, we refute their claims and demonstrate that their critique is based on fundamental misunderstandings caused by mixing up statistical metrics and using simple normative explanations to interpret highly complex datasets.

FAO will continue to work closely with member states, IGOs, NGOs, academia and civil society, to further improve fishery and aquaculture databases, while calling on states to make renewed efforts to improve data quality. It also welcomes research efforts that contribute to the improvement of statistical data which are critical to the sustainable management of fisheries and aquaculture.},

ENSO exerts its impacts on remote regions of the globe through atmospheric teleconnections, affecting extreme weather events worldwide. However, these teleconnections are inherently nonlinear and sensitive to ENSO SST anomaly patterns and amplitudes. In addition, teleconnections are modulated by variability in the oceanic and atmopsheric mean state outside the tropics and by land and sea ice extent. The character of ENSO as well as the ocean mean state have changed since the 1990s, which might be due to either natural variability or anthropogenic forcing, or their combined influences. This has resulted in changes in ENSO atmospheric teleconnections in terms of precipitation and temperature in various parts of the globe. In addition, changes in ENSO teleconnection patterns have affected their predictability and the statistics of extreme events. However, the short observational record does not allow us to clearly distinguish which changes are robust and which are not. Climate models suggest that ENSO teleconnections will change because the mean atmospheric circulation will change due to anthropogenic forcing in the 21st century, which is independent of whether ENSO properties change or not. However, future ENSO teleconnection changes do not currently show strong intermodel agreement from region to region, highlighting the importance of identifying factors that affect uncertainty in future model projections.},

  abstract = {Generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs) are commonly used to standardize catch rates as relative abundance indices in fisheries stock assessments. Spatial interpolation (SI) is an alternative way to estimate relative abundance indices but there have been no comparisons of the effectiveness of the two types of approaches. In the present study, the performances of GLMs, GAMs and SI were compared through a simulation study based on fishery independent surveys of yellow perch in Lake Erie in 1990, 1991, 1992, 2000, 2001, and 2003. Simulated scenarios were tested with sample sizes of 60, 120 and 180 drawn randomly from the survey data, and random errors variances of 0.5, 1 and 2 \texttimes{} the ``true'' estimate variances. For each combination of sample size and error, 100 simulations were calculated to estimate correlation between the ``true'' abundance and the estimated relative abundance indices from GLMs, GAMs and SI. The performances of all three methods improved with increasing sample sizes, but worsened with increasing magnitude of the simulated errors. SI performed better than GLMs and GAMs when the simulated errors were low, but SI was more sensitive than GLMs and GAMs to the magnitude of the simulated random errors. When simulated sampling covered the survey area incompletely, GLMs and GAMs performed better than SI.},

  abstract = {As part of the global marine fisheries catch reconstruction project conducted by the Sea Around Us over the last decade, estimates were derived for discards in all major fisheries in the world. The reconstruction process derives conservative but non-zero time-series estimates for every fisheries component known to exist, and relies on a wide variety of data and information sources and on conservative assumptions to ensure comprehensive and complete time-series coverage. Globally, estimated discards increased from under 5~million t/year (t~=~1,000~kg) in the early 1950s to a peak of 18.8 million t in 1989, and gradually declined thereafter to levels of the late 1950s of less than 10 million t/year. Thus, estimated discards represented between 10\% and 20\% of total reconstructed catches (reported landings~+~unreported landings~+~unreported discards) per year up to the year 2000, after which estimated discards accounted for slightly less than 10\% of total annual catches. Most discards were generated by industrial (i.e. large-scale) fisheries. Discarding occurred predominantly in northern Atlantic waters in the earlier decades (1950s\textendash{}1980s), after which discarding off the West Coast of Africa dominated. More recently, fleets operating in Northwest Pacific and Western Central Pacific waters generated the most discards. In most areas, discards consist essentially of marketable taxa, suggesting a combination of poor fishing practices and poor management procedures is largely responsible for the waste discarding represents. This is important in an era of increasing food security and human nutritional health concerns, especially in developing countries.},

To evaluate harvest strategies, we developed S\textendash{}R relationships for three major crab stocks in Alaska: Bristol Bay red king crab, Paralithodes camtschaticus, Bristol Bay Tanner crab, Chionoecetes bairdi and eastern Bering Sea snow crab, Chionoecetes opilio. We used abundance and recruitment estimates from length-based models, based on growth data for recruitment age and estimated effective spawning biomass from male and female abundance, male fertilization capability, sex ratio, size and shell condition of males, molting period duration of the female population and duration of male attendance during mating. Results varied with species. For red king crab, weak recruitment was associated with extremely small spawning biomass and strong recruitment was associated with intermediate spawning biomass, suggesting possible density-dependent effects. However, the king crab recruitment trends were also consistent with patterns of decadal climate shifts. Results were equivocal and a general Ricker model fit the king crab data slightly better than an autocorrelated Ricker model. For Tanner crab, the autocorrelated Ricker model fit the data much better than the general model and most of the variability of Tanner crab recruitment can be explained by a cycle with a period of 13\textendash{}14 years. For snow crab, the autocorrelated Ricker model generally fit the data much better than the general model and S\textendash{}R observations formed a circular pattern. Despite the weak evidence for S\textendash{}R relationships, harvest strategies must be precautionary to reduce the risk that crab stocks fall to levels so low that reproductive output is insufficient to produce large year classes when environmental conditions become favorable.},

  abstract = {We present a quantitative approach to the ecological Sustainability Assessment for Fishing Effects (SAFE) on diverse and data-poor bycatch assemblages. The method estimates fishing impact and compares the impact to sustainability reference points based on basic life-history parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by assessing the impact of Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF) on the sustainability of 51 elasmobranch bycatch species. We estimated the proportion of the population distributed within trawled areas, from detection\textendash{}nondetection data collected from scientific surveys. This estimate of species' abundance was then included in a model incorporating catch rate and escapement probability to give an estimate of the fishing mortality rate of each species. To guide management of bycatch species, we established two reference points based on natural mortality rate and growth rate: maximum sustainable fishing mortality and minimum unsustainable fishing mortality. The proportion of the 51 species' populations distributed within the fished area ranged between 0.02 and 1.00 (mean 0.36 {$\pm$} S.D. 0.31). Our results indicated that fishing impacts may have exceeded the maximum sustainable fishing mortality for 19 species, and exceeded the minimum unsustainable fishing mortality for 9 species. However, the estimates were highly uncertain for some species. SAFE can also be used by scientists and fishery managers to focus monitoring programs on potentially at-risk species to obtain additional data for further sustainability evaluation. Because the framework of SAFE is compatible with the management of target species, it can be incorporated into existing fishery management strategies, and may fulfill emerging ecosystem-based fishery management objectives.},

This crisis, along with increasing concerns over flow-on effects on ecosystems, has caused a reevaluation of traditional fisheries management practices, and a new ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) paradigm has emerged. As part of this approach, selective fishing is widely encouraged in the belief that nonselective fishing has many adverse impacts. In particular, incidental bycatch is seen as wasteful and a negative feature of fishing, and methods to reduce bycatch are implemented in many fisheries. However, recent advances in fishery science and ecology suggest that a selective approach may also result in undesirable impacts both to fisheries and marine ecosystems. Selective fishing applies one or more of the ``6-S'' selections: species, stock, size, sex, season, and space. However, selective fishing alters biodiversity, which in turn changes ecosystem functioning and may affect fisheries production, hindering rather than helping achieve the goals of EBFM. We argue here that a ``balanced exploitation'' approach might alleviate many of the ecological effects of fishing by avoiding intensive removal of particular components of the ecosystem, while still supporting sustainable fisheries. This concept may require reducing exploitation rates on certain target species or groups to protect vulnerable components of the ecosystem. Benefits to society could be maintained or even increased because a greater proportion of the entire suite of harvested species is used.},

Contrary to what might be expected, we find that a risk pooling mechanism (through either collective quotas or ITQs) does not necessarily reduce the probability of quota overages. We also show that for arbitrary penalties, the incentive effects faced by harvesters differ under the various approaches. The ability of regulators to optimally adjust the enforcement mechanism (here the quota price) plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of the different approaches. Finally, the optimal quota prices and the conditions that trigger them differ across the approaches; hence the impacts on expected profits differ as well. JEL Codes: D62, D70, Q22, Q28.},

However, stock depletion is extremely difficult to estimate, particularly with limited data. Using the RAM Legacy database, we developed a boosted regression tree (BRT) model to correlate depletion with a range of predictors calculated from catch data, making the model usable for many fisheries worldwide. The most important predictors were found to be catch trends obtained from linear regressions of scaled catch on time, including regression coefficients for the whole catch time series, the subseries before and after the maximum catch, and in recent years. Eight predictors explain about 80\% of variation in depletion. There is a correlation of .5 between measured levels of depletion and the predictions of the BRT model. Predictions are less biased when the stock is fished down below half of the carrying capacity. The BRT model outperforms comparable existing catch-based depletion estimators and could be used to provide priors for depletion for data-poor stock assessment methods, or used more directly to provide estimates of the probability that depletion is below a given threshold value.},

  abstract = {The number of marine protected areas (MPAs) has grown exponentially worldwide over the past decade in order to meet international targets. Most of these protected areas allow extraction of resources and are therefore designated as ``partially protected areas'' (PPAs). However, the effectiveness of PPAs remains unclear due to the high variability of use types permitted. Here, we carried out what we believe to be the first global meta-analysis of PPAs using a regulation-based classification system for MPAs to assess their ecological effectiveness. This novel classification allows for unambiguous differentiation between areas according to allowed use, which is the key feature determining PPA performance. Highly and moderately regulated areas exhibited higher biomass and abundance of commercial fish species, whereas fish abundance and biomass in weakly regulated areas differed little from unprotected areas. Notably, the effectiveness of moderately regulated areas can be enhanced by the presence of an adjacent fully protected area. We concluded that limited and well-regulated uses in PPAs and the presence of an adjacent fully protected area confer ecological benefits, from which socioeconomic advantages are derived.},

  abstract = {Scientific investigation is of value only insofar as relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously communicating the significance of data. In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.},

  abstract = {1.\hspace{0.6em}While teaching statistics to ecologists, the lead authors of this paper have noticed common statistical problems. If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2.\hspace{0.6em}Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3.\hspace{0.6em}Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4.\hspace{0.6em}Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.},
