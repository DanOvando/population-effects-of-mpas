Funding for the simulation model was provided by the National Marine Fisheries Service-SeaGrant Population and Ecosystem Dynamics Fellowship. Empirical data collection was funded primarily by the David and Lucille Packard Foundation in support of the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) with additional funding from the California Ocean Protection Council and California SeaGrant. This study would not have been possible without the work provided by PISCO divers over the years. We especially thank K. Davis Koehn, and A. Parsons-Field. We also thank C. Szuwalski, J. Lawson, A. Punt, C. Brown, and 2 anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and technical support.
